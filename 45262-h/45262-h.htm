<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c004'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br />IN THE VALLEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Turning over his morning mail, which Jared
Fogg had just brought into the little Maine valley,
Mr. Chisholm Dacre, the Bungalow Boys’
uncle, came across a letter that caused him to
pucker up his lips and emit an astonished whistle
through his crisp, gray beard. A perplexed
look showed on his sun-burned face. Turning
back to the first page, he began to read the
closely written epistle over once more.</p>

<p class='c006'>Evidently there was something in it that caused
Mr. Dacre considerable astonishment. His reading
of the missive was not quite completed,
however, when the sudden sound of fresh, young
voices caused him to glance upward.</p>

<p class='c006'>Skimming across the deep little lake stretched
in front of the bungalow came a green canoe. It
contained two occupants, a pair of bright-faced
lads, blue-eyed and wavy-haired. Their likeness
left no doubt that they were brothers. In khaki
trousers and canoeing caps, with the sleeves of
their gray flannel shirts rolled up above the elbow
exposing the tan of healthy muscular
flesh, they were as likely a looking couple of lads
as you would have run across in a muster-roll of
the vigorous, clean-limbed youth of America.
Regular out-of-door chaps, they. You couldn’t
have helped taking an immediate liking to Tom
Dacre and his young brother Jack if you had
stood beside Mr. Dacre that bright morning in
early summer and watched the lightly fashioned
craft skimming across the water, its flashing paddles
wielded by the aforesaid lusty young arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, who would think to look at those two
lads that they had but recently undergone such
an experience as being marooned in the
Tropics?” murmured Mr. Dacre to himself, as he
watched his two nephews draw nearer.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a fond and proud light in his eyes
as they dwelt on his sturdy young relatives. In
his mind he ran over once more the stirring incidents
in which they had all three participated
in the Bahamas, and which were fully related in
a previous volume of this series—“The Bungalow
Boys Marooned in the Tropics.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Our old readers will be able to recall, too, the
bungalow, and the lake, and the country surrounding
them. These environments formed the
scene of the first volume of this series—“The
Bungalow Boys.”</p>

<p class='c006'>How different the little Maine lake looked now
to its appearance the last time we saw it. Then
it was swollen, angry, and discolored by the tumultuous
waters of a cloudburst. At the water
gate leading to the old lumber flume stood Tom
Dacre and Sam Hartley, horror on their faces,
while out on the lake, clinging to a capsized
canoe, were two figures—those of a man and a
boy. Suddenly the man raises his hand, and the
next instant a cowardly blow has left him the
sole occupant of the drifting canoe. Swept on
by the current, the lad, his features distorted by
fear, is being sucked into the angry waters of
the flume, when a figure leaps into the water to
the rescue, and——</p>

<p class='c006'>But we are wandering from the present aspect
of things. All that happened a good while
ago, when the Bungalow Boys were having their
troubles with the “Trubblers,” as old Jasper
used to call them. At that time the little valley,
not far from the north branch of the Penobscot
River, was, as we know, tenanted by a desperate
gang of rascals bent on ousting the lads from
their strange legacy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Everything is very different in the valley now.
The old lumber camp up the creek—in the waters
of which Jumbo, the big trout, used to lurk—has
been painted and carpentered, and carpeted
and furnished, till you wouldn’t know it for the
same place. Mrs. Sambo Bijur, a worthy widow,
is conducting a boarding house there to the huge
disgust of the boys. Somehow, exciting—perilously
so—as the old days often were, they have
several times caught themselves wishing they
were back again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s getting awfully tame,” were Tom’s words
only the day before, when he had finished fishing
the youngest of the Soopendyke family—of
New York—out of the lake in which the said
youngest member of the Soopendykes had been
bent on drowning himself, or so it seemed. His
distracted mother had rushed up and down on
the shore the while.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like an old biddy that has discovered one of
her chickens to be a duck,” chuckled Jack, in relating
the story.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And she kissed me,” chimed in Tom, with intense
disgust, “and said I was a real nice boy, and
if I’d come up to the boarding house some day
she’d let me have a saucer of ice cream.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Dacre had laughed heartily at this narration.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Too old for ice cream since we defeated the
wiles of Messrs. Walstein, Dampier and Co.—eh,
Tom?” he exclaimed, leaning back in his big
chair on the bungalow porch and laughing till
the tears ran down his weather-beaten cheeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It—it isn’t that, sir,” Jack had put in, “but
a fellow—well, he objects to being slobbered
over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better than being shot at, though, isn’t it,
lads?” inquired Mr. Dacre, his gray eyes holding
a merry twinkle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Um—well,” rejoined Tom, with a judicial
air, “you know, Uncle, we’ve seen so much more
exciting times in this old valley that it seems
strange and unnatural to be overrun with Widow
Bijur’s boarders. If it isn’t one of the little
Soopendykes that’s in trouble, it’s Professor Dalhousie
Dingle, with that inquiring child of his.
I never saw such a child. Always asking questions.
The other day the professor caught a bug
and proceeded to stick a pin through it as he always
does.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Pa,’ asked Young Dingle, ‘does that hurt the
bug?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I suppose so, my son,’ answered the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Then the bug doesn’t like it?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘I guess not.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Will the bug die?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Undoubtedly, my boy.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Why do you kill bugs, papa?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘For the purposes of science, my boy,’ answered
the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Pa?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Yes, Douglas.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What is science?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘It’s—it’s—ah, well, the art of explaining
things, my boy.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Does it tell everything?’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Yes, my boy.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Then what killed the Dead Sea, Pa?’”</p>

<p class='c006'>Up to this point Mr. Dacre had listened
gravely enough, but here he had to burst into a
roar of laughter. When his merriment had subsided,
he wished to know how the professor had
dealt with such a “stumper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What did he say to that, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” laughed Tom, “I guess it was too
much for him, for I heard him call Mrs. Bijur
and ask her to give the lad a cookie. He said
the boy’s brain was so large it was eating up
his mind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This conversation is related so that the reader
may form some idea of how the valley has
changed from the last time we participated in the
Bungalow Boys’ adventures therein. Mrs. Bijur
had other boarders, but Mrs. Soopendyke, with
her numerous progeny, and Professor Dingle and
his inquiring son, were the most striking types.
But while we have been relating something of
the Bungalow Boys’ neighbors, they have run
their canoe up to the wharf, made fast the
painter, and, with paddles over their shoulders—for
fear of predatory Soopendykes—made
their way up to the porch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Out early to-day, Tom,” was Mr. Dacre’s
greeting.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, we thought we’d see if we couldn’t succeed
in getting a bass or two before the sun got
too hot,” rejoined Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you did?”</p>

<p class='c006'>For answer Tom held up a string of silvery
beauties.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not bad for two hours’ work,” laughed Jack,
leaning his rod against the porch.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, indeed, and more especially as Jasper
has just informed me that we are almost out of
meat. I was thinking of taking a stroll up to
Mrs. Bijur’s after a while, to see if I could borrow
some. Do you boys want to go?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom threw up his hands and burst into a
laugh in which Jack joined.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Might as well,” they chuckled. “At all events,
there’s always something amusing going on up
there. By the way, the bugologist” (Tom’s name
for the dignified Professor Dingle) “is off on a
new tack now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that so?” inquired Mr. Dacre interestedly,
“and what is that, pray?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why he’s got some wonderful notion about a
new explosive. He’s been experimenting with
it for some days now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A new explosive!” echoed Mr. Dacre, in an
amazed tone; “well, what does he expect to do
with that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sell it to the government, I guess,” chuckled
Tom. “I’ll bet, though, it won’t be as effective
as that electric juice we turned into the handrail
of the dear old <i>Omoo</i> off Don Lopez’s
island.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think it would have to be pretty powerful
to equal the effects of that, indeed,” laughed Mr.
Dacre, rising and thrusting the letter which had
interested him so much into a side pocket of his
loose linen jacket. He reached for his hat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, let’s be starting before it gets really
warm. By the way, boys, as we go along I’ve
something to talk to you about. But first I want
to ask you a question. I want you to answer it
honestly. Aren’t you getting a bit tired of your
bungalow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom and Jack exchanged glances. As we
know, the bungalow and the estate surrounding
it, was their “legacy” from their uncle, and not
for worlds would they have admitted that they
were getting a little tired of the pleasant monotony
of their lives there. But being ingenuous
lads they had not been able to conceal it—as has
been hinted, in fact.</p>

lads they had not been able to conceal it—as has

<p class='c006'>“Come,” said Mr. Dacre, a quizzical smile
playing about the corners of his firm, yet kind,
mouth. “Speak out; haven’t you exchanged
views about the monotony of perfect plain sailing,
or something of that sort?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, uncle, you must be a wizard!” exclaimed
Tom. “Have you overheard us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then both lads burst into a laugh, seeing how
they had betrayed themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There, there,” chuckled Mr. Dacre, “you’d
never do for diplomats—too honest,” he murmured,
half to himself; “but, as Jasper would
say—being as how you have given yourselves
away, I have something to propose to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hurray!” shouted Jack, capering about, “a
trip? I’ll bet the hole out of a doughnut it’s a
trip!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you would win that bet,” cried Mr.
Dacre, drawing out the letter from his pocket.
“In the mail to-day there came a letter from
a man from whom I have not heard for some
time—a good many years, in fact.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A cloud passed over Mr. Dacre’s face. They
could see that for a moment he was back in the
old painful past. But it passed as rapidly as a
shadow on the surface of the rippling lake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My friend has a ranch in Washington State,”
he went on, while the boys, with parted lips and
sparkling eyes, fairly drank in his words. “It
appears that he read in the papers about our adventures
in the tropics. This letter is the result.
He informs me that if I am anxious to make an
investment with a part of the treasure of the
lost galleon, that no better opportunity offers
than the timber and fruit country of Washington.
He says that he imagines that I must be anxious
for rest anyhow, and, to make a long story short,
he extends to me and to my two celebrated
nephews”—the boys blushed—“a hearty invitation
to visit him, renew old friendship, and take
a look at the country. What do you say, boys—shall
we go?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say, ever since I read that book on the Great
Northwest of our country I’ve longed to get out
there. Jack and I have talked it over many a
time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here Jack nodded vigorously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will we go, uncle? Well,” Tom paused as
he cast about for a fitting phrase, “well,” he
burst out, “if we <i>don’t</i>, your Bungalow Boys will
be Grumble-oh! boys.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I will write him this afternoon that we
will come,” said Mr. Dacre soberly, though it
was easy to see that he was almost as pleased
as the lads at their decision. As for the boys,
they joined in a wild half-war-dance, half-waltz
that didn’t end till Jack was almost waltzed into
the lake—not that in his frame of mind he would
have cared.</p>

<p class='c006'>At this stage of the proceedings an inky-black
countenance, crowned with a tightly curling crop
of grayish wool, projected from a rear door of
the bungalow. It was Jasper—former servant of
Dr. Parsons, but now attached to the Bungalow
Boys’ uncle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fo’ de lan’s sake!” he cried, throwing up his
hands in consternation. “Dem boys done be
actin’ up lak dey was two crazy pertatur bugs.
Misto Dacon” (Dacre was beyond Jasper), “Mr.
Dacon, sah, does I git dat meat o’ does we dine
on flap jacks an’ bacum?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You get the meat,” laughed Mr. Dacre, regarding
with intense amusement the tragic mien
of his colored servitor. “Come, boys, give Jasper
your fish—just to ease his mind—and insure the
safety of Mrs. Bijur’s chickens—and then let’s
hurry on our errand. There’s a lot to do before
we start for The Great Northwest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The great northwest!” echoed Tom, picking
up the now despised string of bass. “If there are
any two finer words in the geographies, I’ve
never heard them.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c007'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br />A “BLOW-UP.”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>All the way to Mrs. Bijur’s—along the well-remembered
trail, with its alder clumps fringing
the crystal-clear Sawmill Creek and the big pool
where of yore lurked Jumbo, and into which Tom
had taken a header on one memorable occasion—there
was naturally only one topic of conversation,
the coming trip, of course. By the
time they reached the former lumber camp, and
the place which had more recently been the headquarters
of the Trulliber gang, the boys had
crossed and recrossed the continent at least half
a dozen times, and the geography and animal
and vegetable history of the State of Washington
been thoroughly discussed. The trim buildings,
now painted white, with red roofs and green
shutters and doors, presented a violent contrast
to the ramshackle collection of structures in
which the Trullibers had squatted.</p>

<p class='c006'>The barn in which Tom lay a prisoner, while
in the next room he had heard Dan Dark and the
others plotting, was now painted a vivid red, and
a neat tin roof glittered above its contents of
spicy-smelling hay and well-fed, sleek cows and
horses. Josiah Bijur had left his widow a snug
little fortune and, with true Maine thrift, she had
spent it to the best advantage. Already she had
more applications for boarders than her place
would hold. If she could have persuaded the boys
she would have liked to rent their bungalow for
the overflow. But the fancy rent she offered
had no allurement for them. Their share of the
treasure of the galleon had made them two very
independent lads.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hamish Boggs, Mrs. Bijur’s hired man, was
clambering off a load of hay as the party from
the bungalow came in sight. He had just hauled
it in from the mountain meadow, not far, by the
way, from the foot of the cliff where Tom took
that memorable slide after his imprisonment in
the cave, which came near proving his grave.</p>

<p class='c006'>Going to the rear of the wagon, which was
halted on the steep grade in front of the house,
he placed two big stones under each of the rear
wheels.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t want the wagon to go rolling down the
hill, eh, Hamish?” said Mr. Dacre, as they came
up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, sir,” responded Hamish emphatically;
“there’s a deep pool in the creek at the bottom
of this grade and if ther old wagin ever started
a-runnin’ daown it—wall, by chowder, she’d take
er bath whether she needed one er not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So saying, he proceeded to unhitch the horses
and lead them toward the barn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why don’t you drag the load in under the
mow?” asked Tom, not quite seeing the object of
leaving the load stalled in front of the house.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wall, yer see,” drawled Hamish, “thet mow’s
got quite a sight of grass inter it naow. By
chowder, ef I tried ter put this load in on top,
it might raise the roof ofen it, so I’m gon’ ter
shift it back a bit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At this juncture Mrs. Bijur appeared—a thin,
sharp-featured woman in a blue calico dress,
with a sunbonnet to match.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wall, land o’ goodness, ef it ain’t Mister
Dacre,” she cried. “Wall, dear suz, what brings
you here? Hamish, yer better ’tend to thet sick
caow afore you put in yer hay. Do it right
arter you’ve got them horses put up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And leave ther hay out thar, mum?” asked
Hamish.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, of course. Nobody ain’t goin’ ter steal
it, be they? Go on with yer. Mr. Dacre, come
in. Hev a glass of buttermilk. Dear suz! if I
ain’t run off my mortal leags, an’—oh, you air a
sniffin’, too, be yer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>She broke off her torrent of talk as she noticed
Mr. Dacre sniffing with a critical nose. The
atmosphere was, in fact, impregnated with a very
queer odor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Guess some senile egg must have gone off and
died round here,” said Tom, with a snicker to
Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s that perfusser,” explained Mrs. Bijur. “I
tole him that he’d hev ter stop experimentin’ ef
it was goin’ ter smell us out o’ house an’ home
this er way. Awful, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, it is rather strong,” admitted Mr.
Dacre, as they took seats in the stuffy parlor,
with its wax fruit under their glass covers, the
imitation lace tidies on the backs of the stiff
chairs, and the noisy, eight-day clock ticking
away like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What ever is the professor doing?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“’Sperimentin’,” sniffed Mrs. Bijur, smoothing
out her apron.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Must be experimenting with cold-storage
eggs,” put in Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” rejoined Mrs. Bijur gravely, “it’s some
sort of a ’splosive. I tell you, Mister Dacre, I’m
terrible skeered. Reely I be. S’pose thet stuff
’ud go off? We’d all be blown up in our beds.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unless you happened to be awake, ma’am,”
answered Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, but he don’t ’speriment only at night,”
was the rejoinder. “He’s off all day huntin’ bugs
and nasty crawly things. It’s only at night he
works at it, an’ I tell yer, I’ve got my hands full
with them Soopendyke children. They’re allers
a-tryin’ to git inter the perfusser’s laboratory—he
calls it. If they ever did, dear knows what
’ud happen. The perfusser says that ef any one
who didn’t understand that stuff was to meddle
with it, it might blow up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mr. Dacre, with
mock anxiety. “I hope the young Soopendykes
are all safely accounted for.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I dunno. There’s no telling whar them
young varmints will git ter,” was the reply.
“They’re every place all ter oncet, and no place
long tergither. Tother day I cotched one tryin’
ter git inter the laboratory. Crawlin’ over ther
roof, he was, and goin’ ter drop inter ther window
by a water pipe. Seems ter me thet they are
just achin’ ter blow themselves up, and——Good
land! Look at ’em now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The widow rushed to the window and shook
her fist at four young Soopendykes who were disporting
themselves in the hay wagon, leaping
about among the fragrant stuff, and pitching it at
one another, to the great detriment of Hamish’s
neat load.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is Mrs. Soopendyke?” inquired Mr.
Dacre, as the widow finished shooing—or imagined
she had done so—the invading youngsters
from their play.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lyin’ down with a headache,” was the rejoinder.
“Poor woman, them young ’uns be a
handful, an’ no mistake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As Mrs. Bijur seemed inclined to enlarge on
her troubles, Mr. Dacre lost no time, as soon as
he could do so, in explaining his errand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Meat!” exclaimed Mrs. Bijur. “Good land,
go daown cellar and help yourself. The boys can
give me some of those nice fresh fish in trade
some time. No, you won’t pay me, Mr. Dacre.
Dear suz, ain’t we neighbors, and—— Land o’
Gosh-en!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The last words came from the good lady in
a perfect shriek. And well they might, for her
speech had been interrupted by a heavy sound
that shook the house to its foundations.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bo-o-o-o-m!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good heavens!” cried Mr. Dacre, rushing out
of the door, followed by the boys. “An explosion!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That thar dratted explosive soup of the perfusser’s
has gone off at last!” shrieked the widow,
following them in most undignified haste. As
they emerged from the house, a shrill cry rang
out:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ma-ma! Oh, ma-ma!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just as I thought, it’s one of them Soopendykes!”
cried Mrs. Bijur. “Good land! Look
at that!”</p>

<p class='c006'>She indicated the extension of the house, a low
one-storied structure, jutting out from the rear.
It was in this that the professor had set up his
“laboratory,” as Mrs. Bijur called it. Her exclamation
was justified.</p>

<p class='c006'>A large hole, some three feet six inches in diameter,
gaped in the once orderly tin roof. Through
the aperture thus disclosed, yellow smoke was
pouring in a malodorous cloud, while, on a refuse
pile not far away, the eldest Soopendyke, Van
Peyster, aged twelve, was picking himself up
with an injured expression. His Fauntleroy suit,
with clean lace cuffs and collar—fresh that morning—was
in blackened shreds. His long yellow
curls were singed to a dismal resemblance
to their former ideal of mother’s beauty. Master
Van Peyster Soopendyke was indeed a melancholy
object, but he seemed unhurt, as he advanced
toward them with howls of:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t mean ter! I didn’t mean ter!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You young catamount!” shrilled the widow.
“What in the name of time hev yer bin a-doin’
of?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Boo-hoo! I jes’ was foolin’ with that stuff
of the professor’s an’ it went off!” howled the
Soopendyke youngster, while the boys likewise
exploded into shouts of laughter. In the meantime,
Mr. Dacre had burst in the locked door and
discovered that, beyond wrecking the laboratory,
the explosion had not done much harm. He had
just finished his examination when Mrs. Soopendyke,
her hair falling in disorder and her ample
form hastily dressed, came rushing out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My boy! My boy!” she cried, in agonized
tones. “Van Peyster, my darling, where are you
hurt; are you——”</p>

<p class='c006'>The good lady had proceeded as far as this
when her eyes fell on the smoke-blackened,
ragged object, which had been blown through the
roof by the force of the explosion. Luckily, his
having landed on the rubbish pile had saved his
limbs. But Master Soopendyke, as has been said,
was an alarming object for a fond parent’s eye
to light upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Van Peyster!” screamed his mother.
“Great heavens——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aw, keep still, maw. I ain’t hurt,” announced
the dutiful son.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, thank heaven for that! Come to
my arms, my darling! My joy! Come——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Soopendyke was proceeding to hurl herself
upon her offspring, who was about to elude
her, when from the front of the house came an
appalling shriek.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s Courtney!” screamed out the unhappy
lady. “Oh, merciful heavens! What is happening
now?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br />AN INVOLUNTARY HAY-RIDE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Louder and louder came the shrieks and cries,
and the party, all of them considerably alarmed,
rushed around to the front of the house to perceive
what this new uproar might mean. They
beheld a sight that made Mrs. Soopendyke begin
to cry out in real earnest.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of her family had, in a playful mood, removed
the stones which held Hamish’s hay
wagon stationary on the steep grade. As a natural
result, it began to slide backward down the
hill. But what had thrilled the good lady with
horror, and the others with not a little alarm, was
the sight of three other young Soopendykes, including
the baby, on the top of the load. It was
from them and from Master Courtney Soopendyke,
who perceived too late the mischief he had
done by removing the stones, that the ear-piercing
yells proceeded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, save them! Oh, save my bee-yoot-i-ful
children!” screamed Mrs. Soopendyke, wringing
her hands, as the ponderous wagon, with its
screaming load of children, began to glide off
more and more rapidly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Great Scott!” shouted Mr. Dacre. “That
deep hole in the creek is at the bottom of the
hill!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” shrilled Mrs. Soopendyke,
and fainted just in time to fall into the arms of
Hamish, who came running round from the barn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Help! Fire! Murder! Send for the fire department!”
screamed Mrs. Bijur, with some confusion
of ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the midst of this pandemonium Tom and
Jack and their uncle alone kept cool heads. Before
the wagon had proceeded very far, the two
Bungalow Boys were off after it, covering the
ground in big leaps. But fast as they went, the
wagon rumbled down the grade—which grew
steeper as it neared the creek—just a little faster
seemingly—than they did. Its tongue stuck
straight out in front like the bowsprit of a vessel.
It was for this point that both lads were aiming.
Tom had a plan in his mind to avert the catastrophe
that seemed almost inevitable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mustering every ounce of strength in his body,
he made a spurt and succeeded in grasping the
projecting tongue. In a second Jack was at his
side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Swing her!” gasped out Tom. “It’s their only
chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But to swing over the tongue of a moving
wagon when it is moving away from you is a
pretty hard task. For a few seconds it looked
as if, instead of succeeding in carrying out Tom’s
suddenly-thought-of plan, both Bungalow Boys
were going to be carried off by the wagon.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a bit of rough ground gave them a foothold,
and, exerting every ounce of power, the
lads both shoved on the springy pole for all they
were worth. Slowly it swung over, and the wagon
altered its course.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Steer her for that clump of bushes. They’ll
stop her!” puffed out Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right,” panted Jack, but as he gasped out
the words there came an ominous sound:</p>

<p class='c006'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wow! The pole’s cracking!” yelled Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next instant the tough wood, which, strong
as it seemed, was sun-dried and old, snapped off
short in their hands under the unusual strain.</p>

<p class='c006'>A cry of alarm broke out from the watchers
at the top of the hill as this occurred. It looked
as if nothing could now save the wagon from
a dive into the creek.</p>

<p class='c006'>But even as the shout resounded and the boys
gave exclamations of disgust at their failure, the
wagon drove into the mass of brush at almost
the exact point for which they had been aiming.
At just that instant a big rock had caught and
diverted one of the hind wheels, and this, combined
with the swing in the right direction already
given the vehicle, saved the day.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a resounding crashing and crackling,
and redoubled yells from the terrified young
Soopendykes on the top of the load, the wagon,
as it plunged into the brush, hesitated, wavered,
and—came to a standstill. But as the wheels
ceased to revolve, Hamish’s carefully piled load
gave a quiver, and, carrying the terrified youngsters
with it, slid in a mighty pile off the wagon-bed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fortunately, the children were on top of the
load, and they extricated themselves without difficulty.
Hardly had they emerged, however, before
a violent convulsion was observed in the
toppled off heap, and presently a hand was seen
to emerge and wave helplessly and imploringly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who on earth can that be?” gasped the boys,
glancing round to make sure all the group was
there. Yes, they were all present and accounted
for,—Mrs. Soopendyke, sobbing hysterically in
the midst of her reunited family, the lads’ uncle,
Mrs. Bijur, Hamish, and several other boarders
who had been aroused by the explosion, and had
set off on a run down the hill as the wagon
plunged into the brush.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before they could hasten forward to the rescue
of whoever was struggling in the hay, a bony
face, the nose crowned with a pair of immense
horn spectacles, emerged. Presently it was joined
by a youthful, pug-nosed countenance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Professor Dalhousie Dingle?” cried everybody,
in astonishment. “And that dratted boy,
Douglas Dingle!” echoed Mrs. Bijur.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, madam,” said the professor solemnly,
emerging with what dignity he could, and then,
taking his boy by the hand and helping him forth,
“It is Professor Dingle. May I ask if this was
intentional?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, dear land, perfusser, you know——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I only know, madam, that while my lad
Douglas here and myself were searching for
specimens in the thicket we suddenly found ourselves
overwhelmed with an avalanche of dried
grass—or, as it is commonly called—hay. Bah!
I am almost suffocated!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The professor carefully extricated a “fox tail”
from his ear and then performed the same kind
office for his son and heir.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pa-pa,” piped up the lad, “may I ask a question?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, my lad,” beamed the professor amiably
stepping down from the pile of hay, which Hamish
was regarding ruefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” spoke up Douglas, “if we had not gotten
out from under that hay, would we have been
suffocated?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Undoubtedly, my boy—undoubtedly,” was the
rejoinder. “Gross carelessness, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He scowled at the assembled group.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would it have hurt, pa-pa?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Surely, my boy. Suffocation, so science tells
us, is a most painful form of death.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Worse than measles, pa-pa?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, my child, and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perfusser,” interrupted Mrs. Bijur, with
firmness, “I want to know what you intend to do
about my roof?”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the professor’s turn to look astonished.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What roof, madam?” he asked, still brushing
hay-seed from his long-tailed black coat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ther roof of my extension whar you hed thet
thar lab-or-at-ory—whar you was making them
messes that was liable to blow up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, madam?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wall, sir—they done it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They done—did what, madam?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Blowed up!” responded Mrs. Bijur, with
deadly calm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good heavens, madam—impossible!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not with them Soopendykes around!” was the
confident response. “It’s my belief they’d a
turned the Garden of Eden inter a pantominium.
They——”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the professor rushed off dragging Douglas
by the hand, his long coat tails flapping in the
air as he sped up the road as fast as his lanky
legs would carry him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The greatest invention of the age has gone
up in smoke!” he yelled, as he flew along.</p>

<p class='c006'>Laughing heartily over the comical outcome of
events that might have proved tragic, Mr. Dacre
and the boys rendered what aid they could in replacing
the hay load, and then started back for
the bungalow. The last they saw of the professor
he was crawling about on his hands and
knees, scooping up fragments of the explosive
with a tin teaspoon in one hand, and waving Mrs.
Bijur indignantly to one side with the other.
They little imagined, as they shook with amusement
at the ludicrous picture, under what circumstances
they were to meet the professor
again, and what a singular part his explosive was
destined to play in the not very far distant future.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br />BULLY BANJO’S SCHOONER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Guess this will be your getting-off place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the deck hands of the smoke-grimed,
shabbily painted old side-wheeler, plying between
Victoria, B. C., and Seattle, paused opposite Mr.
Dacre and the Bungalow Boys. They stood on
the lee side of the upper deck regarding the expanse
of tumbling water between them and the
rocky, mountainous coast beyond. The sky was
blue and clean-swept. A crisp wind, salt with
the breath of the Pacific, swept along Puget
Sound from the open sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The surging waters of the Sound reflected, but,
with a deeper hue, the blue of the sky. The
mountainous hills beyond were blue, too,—a purplish-blue,
with the dark, inky shadows of big
pines and spruces. Here and there great patches
of gray rock, gaunt and bare as a wolf’s back,
cropped out. Behind all the snow-clad Olympians
towered whitely.</p>

<p class='c006'>Off to port of where the steamer was now
crawling slowly along—a pall of black, soft coal
smoke flung behind her—was a long point,
rocky and pine-clad like the mountains behind
it. On the end of it was a white, melancholy
day-beacon. It looked like a skeleton against its
dark background.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s Dead Man’s Point,” added the
friendly deck hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And Jefferson Station is in beyond it?” asked
Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right. Must look lonesome to you
Easterners.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It certainly does,” agreed Mr. Dacre.
“Boys,” he went on, looking anxiously landward,
“I don’t see a sign of a shore boat yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At this point of the conversation the captain
pulled his whistle cord, and the ugly, old side-wheeler’s
siren emitted a sonorous blast.</p>

<p class='c006'>Poking his head out of the pilot house window,
he shouted down at Mr. Dacre and the boys:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m a goin’ ter lay off here for ten minutes. If
no shore boat shows up by that time, on we go to
Seattle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very well,” responded Mr. Dacre, hiding his
vexation as best he could. “We must—but,” he
broke off abruptly, as from round the point there
suddenly danced a small sloop. “I guess that’s
the boat now, captain!” he hailed up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hope so, anyhow,” ejaculated Tom, while the
captain merely gave a grunt. He was annoyed
at having to slow up his steamer. As the engine
room bell jingled, the clumsy old side wheels beat
the water less rapidly. Presently the old tub lay
rolling in the trough of the sea almost motionless.
On came the boat under a press of canvas. She
heeled over smartly. In her stern was an upright
figure; the lower part of his face was covered
with a big, brown beard. As he saw the party,
he waved a blue-shirted arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s Colton Chillingworth!” exclaimed Mr.
Dacre. “I haven’t seen him for ten years, but
I’d know that big outline of a man any place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The deck hands were now all ready with the
travelers’ steamer trunks. The boys had their
suit cases, gun bags, and fishing rods in their
hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How on earth are we ever going to board that
boat?” wondered Jack, rather apprehensively, as
the tiny craft came dancing along like a light-footed
terpsichorean going through the mazes of
a quadrille.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jump!” was Mr. Dacre’s response. “These
steamers don’t make landings. I’m glad Chillingworth
was in time, or we might have been
carried on to Seattle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And now the boat was cleverly run in alongside.
She came up under the lee of the heavily
rolling steamer, her sails flapping with a loud
report as the wind died out of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hul-lo, Dacre!” came up a hearty hail from
the big figure in the stern. “Hullo there, boys!
Ready to come aboard?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aye, aye, Colton!” hailed back Mr. Dacre.
“We’ll be with you in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we don’t tumble overboard first,” muttered
Jack to himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better take the lower deck, sir,” suggested
one of the deck hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Accordingly, our party traversed the faded
splendors of the little steamer’s saloon and
emerged presently by her paddle box. Between
the side of the vessel and the big curved box was
a triangular platform.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stand out on this, sir, and you and the boys
jump from it,” suggested the deck hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A whole lot easier to say than to do,” was
Tom’s mental comment. He said nothing aloud,
however.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime their baggage had been lowered
by a sling. A second person, who had just
emerged from the cabin of the little boat, was active
in stowing it in the cockpit. This personage
was a Chinaman. He wore no queue, however,
but still clung to the loose blue blouse and trousers
of his country.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Allee lightee. You come jumpee now,” he
hailed up, when the baggage was stowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here goes, boys,” cried Mr. Dacre, with a
laugh. He made a clean spring and landed on
the edge of the deck of the plunging sloop. The
Chinaman caught him on one side, while the lad’s
uncle braced himself on the other by grabbing a
stay. Another instant and the boys could see him
and Mr. Chillingworth warmly shaking hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go ahead, Jack,” urged Tom. But for once
Jack did not seem anxious to take the lead. He
hesitated and looked about him. But he only
saw the grinning faces of the deck hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on!” shouted his uncle, extending his
arms. “It’s easy. We’ll catch you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hum! If I had my diving suit here, I’d feel
better,” muttered the lad. “But—here goes!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Like a boy making a final determined plunge
into a cold tub on a winter morning, Jack leaped
forward<a id='fpc43'/> and outward. He landed right on the
sloop’s deck, falling in a sprawling heap. But
the active Chinaman had him by the arms and he
was on his feet in a jiffy. Tom followed an instant
later.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hardly had his foot touched the deck before
the steamer gave a farewell blast and forged onward,
leaving them alone in the tossing, tumbling
wilderness of wind-driven waters. Somehow the
waves looked a lot bigger from the cockpit of the
sloop than they had from the deck of the steamer.</p>

<p class='c006'>They watched the big craft as with a dip and
a splash of its wet plates, it gained speed again,
several passengers gazing from its upper decks
at the adventurous party in the little sloop. Introductions
were speedily gone through by Mr.
Dacre. The boys made up their minds that they
were going to like Colton Chillingworth very
much. He was a big-framed six-footer, tanned
with wind and sun, and under his flannel shirt
they could see the great muscles play as he moved
about.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is Song Fu, my factotum,” said Mr.
Chillingworth, nodding toward the Chinaman,
whose yellow face expanded into a broad grin as
his master turned toward him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do you do, Song Fu?” poetically asked
Tom, not knowing just what else to say.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me welly nicely, t’ank you,” was the glib response.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this time Mr. Chillingworth had set the
helm and put the little sloop about. She fairly
flew through the water, throwing back clouds of
spray over the top of her tiny cabin. It was exhilarating,
though, and the boys enjoyed every
minute of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as they sped along, it soon became apparent
that the wind was freshening. The sea,
too, was getting up. Great green waves towered
about the boat as if they would overwhelm her.
The combers raced along astern, and every minute
it seemed as if one of them must come climbing
over, but none did.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Got to take another reef,” said Mr. Chillingworth
presently. “Can either of you boys handle
a boat?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what a question,” exclaimed Mr. Dacre.
“If you had seen them managing the <i>Omoo</i> in
that gale off Hatteras, you’d have thought they
could handle a boat, and well, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That being the case, Tom here can take the
tiller, while I help Fu take in sail.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Chillingworth resigned the tiller to Tom,
who promptly brought the sloop up into the wind,
allowing her sails to shiver. This permitted Mr.
Chillingworth and the Chinaman to get at the
reef points and tie them down. This done, the
owner of the boat came back to the cockpit and
she was put on her course once more.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You handled her like a veteran,” said Mr.
Chillingworth to Tom, who looked pleased at
such praise coming from a man whom he had
already made up his mind was a very capable citizen.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rancher went on to explain something of
his circumstances. He and his wife had come
out there some years before. They were doing
their best to wrest a living from the rough country.
But it was a struggle. Mr. Chillingworth
admitted that, although he had big hopes of the
country ultimately becoming a new Eldorado.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just at present, though, it’s a little rough,”
he admitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, we don’t mind roughing it,” responded
Tom. “We’re used to that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So I should imagine from the newspaper accounts
I read of your prowess,” said Mr. Chillingworth
dryly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, they wrote a lot of stuff that didn’t happen
at all,” put in Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not to mention the pictures,” laughed Mr.
Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Mr. Chillingworth, “if there were
some enterprising reporter out here now, he
would find plenty to write about.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How’s that?” inquired Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, you may have heard of Chinese smugglers—that
is to say, men who run Chinamen
into the country without the formality of their
obtaining papers?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Dacre nodded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something of the sort,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, they have been pretty active here recently.
Some of the ranchers have had trouble
with them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But surely they have notified the authorities?”
exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just it,” said Mr. Chillingworth.
“They are all afraid of the rascals. Scared of
having their buildings burned down, or their
horses hamstrung, or something unpleasant like
that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, if you are the same old Colton Chillingworth,”
smiled Mr. Dacre, “I’m sure you do not
belong in that category.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A look came over Colton Chillingworth’s face
that the boys had not noticed on that rugged
countenance before. Under his brown beard, his
lips set firmly, and his eyes narrowed. Colton
Chillingworth, with that expression on his features,
looked like a bad man to have trouble with.
But to Mr. Dacre’s astonishment, and the no less
surprise of the boys, his reply was somewhat
hesitant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you see, Dacre,” he said uncertainly, “a
married man has others than himself to look out
for. By the way, my wife doesn’t know anything
about the troubles. Please don’t mention them
to her, will you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Certainly not,” was the rejoinder. “But——”</p>

<p class='c006'>A sudden cry from the Chinaman cut his
words short. The Mongolian raised a hand, and
with a long, yellow finger pointed off to the west.
The boys, following with their eyes the direction
in which he pointed, at first could descry nothing,
but presently, as the sloop rose on the top of
a wave, they could make out, in the blue distance,
the sudden flash of a white sail on the
Sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s the schooner, Fu?” asked Mr. Chillingworth
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Celestial nodded. No change of expression
had come over his mask-like features, but
the boys vaguely felt that behind the impenetrable
face lay a troubled mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Dacre looked his questions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is there about the schooner particularly
interesting?” he asked, at length.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, nothing much,” said Mr. Chillingworth,
with what seemed rather a forced laugh. “Except
that she is Bully Banjo’s craft.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bully Banjo?” echoed Mr. Dacre, in a puzzled
tone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. Or Simon Lake’s, to give the rascal his
real name. Lake is the man who is at the present
time the real ruler of the ranchers in this
district,” said Mr. Chillingworth bitterly.
“Dacre,” he went on, “I’m afraid that I have invited
you into a troubled region. I’ll give you my
word, though, that when I wrote to you things
were quiet enough.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dear fellow,” was the rejoinder, “don’t
apologize. I myself relish a little excitement,
and here are two boys who live on it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If that is the case,” replied the other, with a
wan smile, “they are on the verge of plenty—or
I’m very much mistaken.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c007'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br />A NIGHT OF MYSTERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Soon after the sloop beat up into the shelter of
the point, the wind having by this time increased,
to what appeared to the boys, to be a mild hurricane.
The sky, too, was overcast, and big black
clouds were rolling in, shrouding the dark trees
and heights ashore in gloom, and turning the
snow-covered peaks beyond to a dull gray. It began
to feel chilly, too.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll have to run up here and take the trail
to the ranch,” said Mr. Chillingworth, after a
while.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought it was quite close in here,” rejoined
Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no. It’s a biggish beat along the coast,”
replied his friend, “but it’s blowing too hard now
to risk beating up the shore. We’ll run in under
shelter of the point there, and then we can cut
across through the woods and reach the place
by trail.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But not to-night,” observed Mr. Dacre, pulling
out his watch. “It’s after four now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll start out to-morrow morning if the
wind hasn’t gone down,” said Mr. Chillingworth.
“Fu can bring the sloop round when the wind
moderates.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not long after this that, as they ran
quite close to the shore, where the rocks sloped
steeply down, that Mr. Chillingworth ordered the
Chinaman to take in sail. Aided by the boys,
this was soon accomplished. To the accompaniment
of rattling blocks, the sails were lowered,
and presently the anchor splashed overboard.
The sloop then lay motionless, about thirty or
forty feet off shore.</p>

<p class='c006'>Supper was cooked and eaten in the tiny cabin,
which boasted a stove. As the air had grown
quite chilly, too, and the boys were wet with
spray, they were all glad to warm and dry themselves
in the heat. After the meal the men drew
out their pipes, while Fu produced a queer-looking
arrangement for smoking. Its bowl was not
much bigger than a thimble and made of stone.
The stem was a long, slender bit of bamboo.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Opium?” whispered Tom to Mr. Chillingworth,
as the Mongolian stepped out of the
cabin to give a look to the anchor.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rancher laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, indeed. I would have no such stuff
around me. I broke Fu of smoking opium long
ago. But he still clings to his old pipe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The after-supper talk was mainly about ranching
and prospects in Washington. Mr. Dacre
appeared to be much interested in the timber aspects
of the country.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are millions of feet of good timber
around here,” said Mr. Chillingworth. “It can
be bought cheap, too, right now. You see, there
is no railroad here yet, and no means of getting
the timber out. It wouldn’t pay to cut it. But
in a few years——”</p>

<p class='c006'>He spread his hands. Evidently he deemed
the prospects to be very good. Mr. Dacre nodded
thoughtfully. Then the two men produced
old envelopes and stubs of pencils and fell to figuring.
This didn’t interest the boys much.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let’s slip outside and see what’s doing,” suggested
Tom to Jack, after a while.</p>

<p class='c006'>The younger lad agreed willingly. In a few
minutes they were on deck. Overhead the wind
roared and shouted, but on deck, sheltered as it
was by the wooded, rocky point, things were comparatively
quiet. Ashore they could hear the
wind humming and booming in the trees like the
notes of a mighty pipe organ. Even where they
stood the balsam-scented breath of the forest was
borne to them. They inhaled it delightedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not unlike Maine,” decided Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once, as they stood there enjoying the
fresh air after the stuffy cabin, Jack gripped
Tom’s arm tightly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hark!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Above the hurly-burly of the wind and the
clamor of the waters as they dashed against the
shore, they could hear a voice upraised in what
was, apparently, a tone of command. Then came
a loud sound of metal rattling. The sound was
unmistakable to any one who had any knowledge
of seafaring.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some vessel’s dropped her anchor not far
from us,” decided Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Right,” assented Jack, “and strain your eyes
a bit and you’ll see that she’s a schooner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Peering into the darkness it was possible to
make out, after a good deal of difficulty, the
black outlines of two masts. They were barely
perceptible, though, and if the boys had not heard
the rattle of the anchor chain and thus known
in which direction to look, they would not have
made them out at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jack!” exclaimed Tom, as a sudden thought
shot into his head, “that must be Bully Banjo’s
schooner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what other vessel would put in here?
It’s true that we had to seek shelter, but a wind
that would sink us wouldn’t bother a large vessel.
This is a lonely place, and just the sort of
harbor Simon Lake would seek.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we are in here; surely he wouldn’t risk
the chance of actual discovery?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But he doesn’t know we’re here. The sloop
is painted black. It is unlikely that he sighted
us beating in for shore this afternoon. We’d better
tell the others.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” agreed Jack, starting for the
cabin door. But Tom laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t open it,” he said. “They’d see the
light.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then how are we to tell them of what we
have seen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tap on the cabin roof and then speak down
the ventilator.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good idea. We’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Chillingworth,” whispered Tom, after his
signal had been answered, and he had hastily
warned the occupants of the cabin not to open
the door, “there’s a big schooner come to anchor
not far away. We thought you ought to
know about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boys could hear an amazed exclamation
come up the ventilator. The next instant the
light was extinguished, and presently the cabin
door was swiftly opened. Mr. Dacre, his friend,
and Fu were soon standing by the boys on the
deck, hearing their story. It was perfectly safe
to talk in natural tones as the wind was blowing
on shore, and it was doubtful if even had they
shouted they could have been heard on the
schooner.</p>

<p class='c006'>On board the larger vessel, however, the case
was different. The group on the yawl could now
hear voices coming down the wind. Lights, too,
began to bob about on the schooner’s decks. Evidently
something was going forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our best plan is to listen and see what we
can find out,” advised Mr. Chillingworth, after
they had discussed the strange arrival of the
schooner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Looks as if they had come in here for some
definite purpose,” said Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” was the rejoinder, “and I can
guess just what that purpose is. Lake’s schooner
has not been round here for some time till the
other day. I believe that she has just arrived
from the island in the Pacific, where they say he
picks up his Chinamen. They may be going to
land a bunch to-night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think so?” asked Jack, his pulses beginning
to beat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see what else they would have sought
out this lonely spot for,” was the rejoinder. “Listen!”</p>

<p class='c006'>A squeaking sound “cheep-cheep” came over
the water from the schooner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are getting ready to lower a boat,” cried
Mr. Chillingworth. “I was right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And they are going to turn a lot of Chinamen
loose ashore?” gasped Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, they won’t turn them loose exactly,”
rejoined Mr. Chillingworth, and if it had not
been dark Tom would have noticed that he smiled.
“Their method, so rumor has it, is to borrow
some rancher’s team and wagon and drive the
yellow men through the woods to a mining district
to the north. Things are run pretty laxly
there, and nobody asks questions so long as they
get Chinese labor cheap.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But doesn’t every Chinaman who comes into
the country have to have a certificate bearing his
picture?” asked Tom. “Seems to me I’ve read
that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perfectly true,” replied Mr. Chillingworth,
“but it’s easy enough for men of Lake’s stripe to
fake such certificates. After the men have
worked at the mines a while, they leave there
and mingle with their countrymen in the Chinatowns
of any large Eastern or Western city. If
any one asks questions, all they have to do is to
show their certificates. As for the pictures, I
guess one does for all. Every Chinaman looks
pretty much alike.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s a fact,” agreed Mr. Dacre, “but all this
must take a lot of money to engineer. Who provides
the funds?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, that’s a mystery. I’ve heard that a big
syndicate is in it. It must pay tremendously.
You see, the Chinamen will pay all the way from
two hundred to a thousand dollars to be landed
safely in the country. Lake, if he manages
things right, can bring in as many as two hundred
at a time. You see for yourself what that
means—sixty thousand dollars at one fell swoop.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Phew!” whistled Mr. Dacre, “no wonder desperate
men will take desperate chances for such
rewards. But you mentioned an island from
which Lake brings the men. Where is it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s pure speculation,” rejoined Mr. Chillingworth.
“The only reason for presuming that
there is an island on which the Chinamen live
till they can be run into the country is this: It
is not probable that a schooner like Lake’s can
run over to China. Her trips, in fact, rarely occupy
more than a month or so. But as for the
location of the island, I am as much in the dark
as you are.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hark!” cried Tom suddenly. “Isn’t that the
sound of oars?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is,” agreed Mr. Dacre, after listening a
minute. “They’ve got a lantern in the boat, too.
See, it is coming this way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sure enough, they could now perceive a light
coming over the water, evidently borne in the
boat the splash of whose oars they had heard.
On through the darkness came the moving light.
Presently it stopped not far from the sloop. The
occupants of the latter could see now that three
men were in the little craft. One, a tall man with
a sailor cap on his head, another, a short, thickset
fellow, and the third man was undoubtedly a
Chinaman. It was too dark to make out features,
but the lantern light shone sufficiently on
the occupants of the small boat for their general
outlines to be apparent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Oriental member of the party wore loose
flowing garb. On his head was a skull-cap surmounted
by a button.</p>

<p class='c006'>But after their first surprise our friends on the
sloop turned their attention from the craft and
its occupants to the freight with which the little
boat was loaded. So far as they could make out,
these were big canvas sacks about five feet or
more in length. There seemed to be more than
one of them. The boat rode very low in the
water, apparently; whatever the freight was, it
was fairly heavy.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the oarsmen ceased their motions and the
boat came to a stop, the men in her arose and
the two white men laid hold of one of the bundles
at either end. They lifted it, and before the
party on the sloop had any idea of what they
were going to do, they had swung their burden
two or three times and then cast it out into the
water. It sank with a sullen splash. As it did
so, the Chinaman raised his hands above his head
and seemed to be uttering some prayer, or invoking
some deity.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a sudden noise in their midst caused the
party on the sloop to turn sharply.</p>

<p class='c006'>For some inexplicable reason the mask-faced
Fu was groveling on the deck. His lips were
murmuring oriental words in a rapid sing-song.
In his voice, and, above all, in his attitude, there
was every indication of abject terror.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Chillingworth stepped over to him and
shook him not too roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fu, Fu, what’s the trouble?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Missa Chillingworth, me welly much
flaid,” stammered the Mongolian, still evidently
in the bonds of fear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But why, Fu—why? Is it because of what
they are doing in that boat?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Missa Chillingworth. Dey be deadee
men in dose sacks. Dey dlop them in the sea for
gib dem belial.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are burying them you mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, missa. De Chinaman he allee same plest.
He say players for dem. Plenty bad for Chinaman
to see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And for any one else, too, I should think,”
commented Mr. Chillingworth. “It is evident
enough now what those fellows are up to. Some
Chinamen have died during the voyage and they
are burying them in this cove. Packed together
as they are, it’s surprising more of them are not
killed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A slight shudder passed through the boys as
they heard. There was something uncanny,
something awe-inspiring about this night burial
in the lonely cove by the light of the lantern.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently the last of the grewsome freight of
the small boat was consigned to the waves, and
she was pulled back to the schooner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We must set a good watch to-night,” said Mr.
Chillingworth. “It is important to know if those
fellows land anybody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The others agreed. Accordingly, it fell to Tom
and Jack to watch the first part of the night,
while the remaining hours were carefully
watched through by Mr. Dacre and Mr. Chillingworth.
Fu was too badly scared by the sight of
the burial of his countrymen to be of much use.
It appeared, according to his belief, that if a
Chinaman gazed on another’s burial without announcing
himself, he would be haunted forever by
the ghosts of the buried ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>The watch was kept faithfully, and carefully,
but nothing occurred apparently to mar the silence
of the dark hours. Yet, when the first
streaks of gray began to show above the pine-clad
shoulders of the coast hills, the dim dawn
showed them that no schooner was there.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c007'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br />MR. DACRE SUSTAINS AN ACCIDENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>During breakfast the mysterious vanishing of
the schooner was discussed, with what eager interest
may be imagined. They could not understand
why the noise of her incoming anchor chain
had not been observed. Nor yet, why the creak
of the blocks and the rattle of the rigging as her
sails were hoisted, had not been heard. It was
Tom who solved the first part of the puzzle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Coming on deck after breakfast, the lad found
the sun sparkling down on the dancing waters,
and flashing brightly on the white-capped wave
tops. Looking in the direction in which he was
sure the schooner had lain the night before, he
perceived a dark object bobbing about on the
water. It looked like a barrel. And so, on investigation,
it proved to be. When the sloop was
sculled alongside by her big sixteen-foot oars,
they found that an anchor chain had been made
fast to the keg. The schooner had silently slipped
her moorings in the night. The fact that the keg
was fast to her anchor chain would make it an
easy matter, however, for her to pick it up again
at her leisure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does that mean that they saw us, do you
think?” asked Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Chillingworth shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If they had seen us,” he said rather grimly,
“I hardly think we should have all been here this
morning. At any rate, that is the reputation that
Bully Banjo has. He has an unpleasant way of
disposing of any one he thinks may have spied on
him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see how in the twentieth century such
a rascal can be permitted at large,” said Mr.
Dacre angrily. “He ought to be captured and his
just deserts dealt out to him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Mr. Chillingworth, “the trouble is
just this. Most of the ranchers hereabouts are
poorish men. The country has not been fully
cleared, and their ranches, so far, yield them
small profits. This Bully Banjo pays well for
the teams he borrows. Generally, when the
horses are returned, there’s a twenty-dollar note
with them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the man is engaged in an illegal business,”
said Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again Mr. Chillingworth smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s mighty hard to get the average man to
see that smuggling anything, from cigars to
Chinamen, is illegal,” he said. “On the contrary,
most men appear to have an idea it’s smart to
beat Uncle Sam. But,” his voice changed and
took on a stern note, “I, for one, am not going to
stand for this rascal’s domineering any longer.
Some weeks ago I wrote to Washington and informed
the Secret Service bureau there exactly
what was going on. They promised to investigate,
but since then I’ve heard nothing more.
You can readily see that it would be folly for me
to make a stand alone against this man. Why,
he’s capable of swooping down on my ranch and
burning it to the ground.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s true,” mused Mr. Dacre thoughtfully.
“I quite see where this Bully Banjo’s power comes
in. But——”</p>

<p class='c006'>He broke off short. Some instinct made him
turn at the moment and he saw that Fu, the
Chinaman, had been eagerly drinking in every
word that had been said. As he met Mr. Dacre’s
eyes, the Mongolian muttered something and
dived into the cabin, ostensibly very busy washing
dishes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You needn’t worry about Fu,” laughed Mr.
Chillingworth. “He’s faithful as the day is long.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know,” said Mr. Dacre seriously.
“Somehow I never like to trust a Chinaman.
They remind me of cats in their mysterious way
of moving about you. If that fellow wanted to,
he could cause you a lot of trouble now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, but he won’t,” laughed Mr. Chillingworth,
“and, in any event, what could he do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why,” said Mr. Dacre slowly, “he could inform
Bully Banjo, for instance, that you have
written to Washington and that the Secret Service
may start an investigation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jove! That’s so!” exclaimed the rancher.
“But,” he laughed lightly, “there’s no fear of
that. Fu is as honest as the day is long. Besides,
he is in my debt. I, and some friends of
mine, rescued him from a gang of white roughs,
who had falsely accused him of a theft, and who
were going to string him up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just the same,” said Mr. Dacre, “I have found
it is a good rule to trust a Chinaman just as far
as you can see him, and in most cases not so far
as that. But, to return to Bully Banjo’s reason
for buoying his anchor, it evidently means that
he intends to come back here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and something else,” said Mr. Chillingworth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, that he just slipped in here to bury the
dead in calm water. That office performed, he
has evidently made off to some other point of the
coast to land his Chinamen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This was admitted to be a plausible explanation.</p>

<p class='c006'>While it was calm enough in the shelter of the
point the loud roaring in the pine tops, and the
distant whitecaps showed that outside it was still
rough. Too rough for the sloop to attempt the
passage, Mr. Chillingworth declared. That being
the case, it was decided to leave the sloop in
the charge of Fu, and to set out overland for
the ranch. When it grew calmer Fu would sail
the sloop around to the waters off the ranch.</p>

<p class='c006'>In accordance with this decision, the sloop was
sculled by Fu close in under a ledge of rocks
where there was deep water. The boys made the
jump ashore with ease. It was then Mr. Dacre’s
turn. Although it has been said that it was calm
in the cove, there was still enough sea running to
make the sloop quite lively, so jumping from her
called for some agility. Mr. Dacre essayed the
leap just as a particularly big wave came sliding
under the little vessel. The consequent lurch upset
his calculations and instead of landing cleanly
on the rock he lost his balance, and would have
fallen back into the water had not Tom seized
him. In another instant Jack, too, had his uncle’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a minute they had him up on the rock, but
instead of standing upright, Mr. Dacre, his face
drawn with pain, and dotted with beads of sweat,
sank to the ground. It was apparent that he was
suffering intense pain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good gracious, Dacre, are you hurt?” asked
Mr. Chillingworth, while the alarmed boys also
poured out questions.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s—it’s nothing,” said Mr. Dacre, with a
brave attempt at a careless smile. “An old fracture
of my leg. I think——”</p>

<p class='c006'>His head fell back and his lips went white.
Had Tom not caught him he would have fallen
prone. Mr. Chillingworth was on the rocks in
a bound as the lad’s uncle lost his senses under
the keen pain.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here, I’m a surgeon in a rough way,” he said.
“One has to be everything out in this rough country.
Let me have a look at that leg.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With a slash of his penknife, he had Mr.
Dacre’s trouser leg ripped open in an instant.
He ran an experienced hand over the limb.
“Hum,” he said, his face growing serious, “an
old fracture—broken again by that fall. Fu, get
me the medicine chest out of the cabin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinaman, his face as stolid as ever,
obeyed. Mr. Chillingworth took from the mahogany
box some bandages, and by the time he
had done this Mr. Dacre’s eyes were opened
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the verdict, Mr. Chillingworth?” he
asked pluckily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, old man,” was the rejoinder, “I don’t
know yet if it’s a fracture or just a sprain. I
hope it’s the latter, and then we’ll have you on
your feet in a few days. The first thing to be
done is to get you back on board the sloop. I’ll
stay with you while these young men and Fu
push on to the ranch and get some remedies of
which I will give them a list.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Dacre made a wry face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it as bad as that? I can’t move?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, just you try it,” said Mr. Chillingworth,—but
one effort was enough for the injured man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Chillingworth, you’ve got a lame duck
on your hands,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nonsense, we’ll soon have you all right again.
Here, boys, you get hold of your uncle’s head.
Fu, place a mattress and some blankets on deck
there. I’ll get hold of his feet. Don’t move till
I say so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not an easy task to get Mr. Dacre back
on board the sloop, but it was accomplished at
last without accident. He was then placed on
the mattress on deck and lay there stiller than
the boys had ever seen his active form.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Chillingworth dived into the cabin. When
he reappeared it was with a penciled list, which
he handed to Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” he said, “now that’s done. Just hand
that to my wife and she’ll give you the necessary
things. By the way, don’t breathe a word to her
about Bully Banjo.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boys promised not to mention the occurrences
of the night. Soon after, Fu was ready.
He carried a small flour sack, with what provisions
could be spared over his shoulders. It
was arranged that they were to get horses at the
ranch and ride back to the sloop, using all the
speed they could. After bidding good-by to their
injured uncle, and Mr. Chillingworth, the little
party set out along the trail. Fu’s blue bloused
and loose trousered form slipped noiselessly along
in front. Behind him toiled the boys. It did not
seem more than a few seconds after they had
left the sloop that they were plunged into a thick
forest. On every side—like the columns of a
vast cathedral—shot up the reddish, smooth
trunks of the great pines. Far above their dark
tops could be caught occasional glimpses of the
blue sky. The brush and vegetation were dense
almost as in the tropics. There is a great deal
of rain in Washington, and the luxuriant growth
is the result. Creepers, flowering shrubs, and big
ferns were everywhere, walling in the trail with
an impenetrable maze of foliage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Above them they could hear the wind blowing
through the dark pines, roaring a deep, musical
bass. But down on the trail it was stiflingly hot.
The heavy, sweet odor of the pines, rank and
resinous was everywhere. They plodded along
in silence, always with that blue, silent figure
gliding along just ahead. It was curious that as
Tom kept his eyes riveted on the noiseless figure
that Mr. Dacre’s words should have recurred to
him with startling force:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Trust a Chinaman only as far as you can see
him, and in most cases not so far as that.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br />THE TALL CHINAMAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For an hour or more they kept steadily on. The
Chinaman in the lead had nothing to say except
to turn his head with an occasional caution to
avoid some obstacle in the path. As for the boys,
after the first mile, they, too, relapsed into silence.
It was rough going, and, although they had been
through some pretty hard ground at times, this
trail through the Washington forest was more
rugged than anything they had hitherto encountered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How far did Mr. Chillingworth say it was to
the ranch?” asked Jack, after a while.</p>

<p class='c006'>“About fifteen miles this way,” rejoined Tom.
“You see, this trail goes fairly parallel with the
coast, but it doesn’t follow all its in and outs. In
that way we cut off a good deal of distance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say that Chinaman is a talkative young
party, isn’t he?” laughed Jack, after another interval
of silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I guess his sort don’t do much talking as a
rule,” rejoined Tom, “but it seems to me that his
moodiness dates from the time he saw that funeral
last night out there in the cove. According
to my way of thinking, he has something on
his conscience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, if he honestly believes that the ghosts
of all those fellows he saw buried are going to
haunt him, no wonder he has something on his
mind,” chuckled Jack. “I’m going to try to get
something out of him, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly he hailed the Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hey Fu, what make trail so crooked?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Injun makee him longee time ago,” responded
the Mongolian. “Him come lock he no movee,
him go lound. Allee same Chinee,” he added,
“too muchee tlouble getee him out of way. Heap
more easty walk lound him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s something in that, too, when you come
to think of it,” mused Tom. “Anyway, it goes to
show the difference between Indians and Chinese
and white men.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I guess that’s the reason neither the Chinese
nor the Indians have ever ‘arrived,’” commented
Jack. “It takes a lot longer to go round than
to keep bang on a straight course.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” assented the other lad. “I
really believe you are becoming a philosopher,
Jack.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like Professor Dingle,” was the laughing answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once more the conversation languished and
they plodded steadily on. But it was warmer now—almost
unbearably so, down in the windless
floor of the forest. From the pine needles a
thick pollen-like dust rose that filled mouth and
nostrils with an irritating dust. The boys’
mouths grew parched and dry. They would have
given a good deal for a drink of clear, sparkling
water.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say, Fu,” hailed Jack presently, “we find
some water pretty soon?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pletty soon,” grunted the Chinaman, who, despite
his fragile frame, seemed tireless and entirely
devoid of hunger or thirst. However,
shortly after noon, when they had reached a spot
where a great rock impended above the trail,
while below their feet the chasm sloped down to
unknown depths, the blue-bloused figure stopped
short in its tireless walk and waited for the boys
to come up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pletty good spling here,” he said, diving off
into the brush with the canteen. “Me catchum
watel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right, catch all you want of it,” cried Jack,
flinging himself exhaustedly on a bed of fern at
the side of the rough path. The Chinaman was
soon back with the water. He lit a fire and
skillfully made tea. With a tin cup each of the
refreshing stuff, the boys soon felt better. From
the bag they lunched on salt beef, crackers and
cheese, and dried apricots. As might be expected,
by mid-afternoon their thirst was once more raging.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How far is it to the ranch?” inquired Tom,
for the dozenth time, as they pluckily plodded
along. Not for worlds would they have let that
silent, fatigueless Chinaman have perceived that
they were almost worn out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Plitty soon we cross canyon. Ranchee him
not far then,” was the response.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing for it but to stick,” muttered Tom
grittily. “But, oh, what wouldn’t I give for a
drink of water. I’m as dry—as dry—as those
dried apricots.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pooh!” retorted Jack. “They were fairly
dripping with moisture compared to the way I
feel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once, a few rods farther, a distant rumbling
sound down in the canyon, and off to the
right, was borne to their ears. Both lads listened
a minute and then gave a joyous whoop.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was water,—a considerable river, apparently.
Anyhow, it was real water, no doubt of
that. As they listened, they could hear it gurgling
and splashing as it dashed along.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hi there, Fu!” hailed Jack, adopting the
Chinaman’s own lingo. “We go catchum water
way down in canyon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But for some reason or other the Chinaman did
not seem anxious for the lads to do this. He
shook his pig-tailed head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You waitee,” he advised. “By um bye find
plentee welly nicee watel.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, this water right here is plentee nicee
for me,” rejoined Jack. “So here goes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Followed by Tom, he plunged off the trail
down the steep declivity, clinging to brush and
small saplings as he went. Grumbling to himself
in a low tone, the Chinaman followed. It
was clear that he thought the proceedings foolish
in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c006'>The descent was longer as well as steeper than
they had imagined it would be, but every minute
the roaring voice of the concealed river or stream
grew louder.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once, they emerged from a clump of
brush, not unlike our eastern alders—almost upon
the bank of a fine river. It was a lot bigger
than they had expected, and was rushing along
with the turbulent velocity characteristic of
mountain water. Here and there were black,
deep eddies dotted with circling flecks of white,
yeasty foam. But the main stream dashed between
its steep, rocky banks like a racehorse,
flinging spray and spindrift high in the air when
it encountered a check. The water was greenish—almost
a glassy tint. The boys learned later
that this was because it was snow water and came
from the high Olympians.</p>

<p class='c006'>Flinging themselves flat by the side of one of
the eddies, they drank greedily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Reminds me of what that kid said when he
showed his mother a fine spring he had discovered,
and the good lady wished to know how to
drink out of it,” chuckled Jack, as they paused for
breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What was that?” inquired Tom, wiping his
wet mouth with the back of a sun-burned hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Why, maw,’ said the kid, ‘you just lie on
your tummy and drink uphill.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That does pretty nearly describe it for a fact,”
agreed Tom. As he spoke, both boys straightened
up from their recumbent position. Hardly
had they done so and were scrambling to their
feet when there came a sudden, sharp crackling
of the brush higher up the stream. Before they
had time to recover from their surprise, or to
even hazard a guess at what the noise might
mean, the brush parted and a figure stepped
forth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both boys uttered a cry of amazement as their
eyes fell on the newcomer. He was a Chinaman—tall,
grave, and with a face like a parchment
mask.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Fu saw him, he fell on his face and began
muttering incoherent noises like those he had
given vent to when he cast himself on the deck
of the sloop the night before.</p>

<p class='c006'>The newcomer was the first to speak. He did
so in a deep, sonorous voice very unlike the
squeaky, jerky mode of utterance of Fu.</p>

<p class='c006'>“White boys come with me,” he said, in a tone
that indicated that he did not expect to be disobeyed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, of all the nerve,” breathed the astonished
Jack to himself. But before he could speak
a word aloud, Tom spoke up:</p>

<p class='c006'>“We are on our way to a ranch,” he said, “and
must reach there by sundown. We’ll have to
hurry on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>No change of expression crossed that yellow
mask, but the tall Chinaman’s hand slipped into
his blouse sleeve, which was loose and flowing.
It was done so rapidly that before the boys had
fairly noticed the movement a revolver was pointing
at them; the sunlight that struck down
through the dark-topped pines glinted ominously
on its blued barrel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinaman, in the same level, monotonous
voice, repeated his command:</p>

<p class='c006'>“White boys come with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, confound it all——” burst out Tom,
but somehow the sight of that tall, motionless
figure, with the expressionless face staring unblinkingly
at them, and the revolver pointed
menacingly in their direction, made him break
off short.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, all right, then,” he said. “I guess we’ll
have to. You’ve got the drop on us. But if there
were any authorities near, you’d hear of this.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>
<img src='images/illus087.jpg' alt='' class='ig003' />
<p>Before the boys had fairly noticed the movement a revolver was pointing at them.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The ghost of a smile flitted across the tall
Chinaman’s hitherto fixed visage. But he made
no comment. Instead, he turned to the recumbent
Fu, and spoke sharply to him in Chinese.
As he was addressed, Fu rose with alacrity and
bowed low three times. He seemed to be terrified
out of his wits, and fairly whimpered as the stern
gaze of his majestic countryman fell upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“White boys walk in front,” ordered the tall
Chinaman, motioning toward the clump of brush
from which he had so suddenly materialized.</p>

<p class='c006'>They now saw that there was a narrow trail
leading through it. And so, down this narrow
path the odd procession started—the two lads
in front, and behind the oddly assorted pair of
Mongolians.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be wrong to say the boys were frightened.
To be frightened, a certain amount of
previous apprehension is necessary. This thing
had happened so suddenly and was so utterly inexplicable
that they were fairly stunned. Their
sensations, as they walked among the thick-growing
bushes, were not unlike those of persons
in a dream. Somehow, at every turn of the
path, they expected to wake up.</p>

<p class='c006'>And wake up they did presently. The wakening
came as, after traversing the narrow trail for
a half mile, they suddenly emerged on a camp
under a clump of big pines. At one side of the
open space in which three tents were pitched, the
stream boiled and roared. On the other, the
precipice shot up. But the camp was screened
from view from above by the brush which grew
out of cracks in the cliff-face. Beyond the river
another wooded precipice arose. This was a
frowning rampart of bare, scarred rock. All this
uneasily impressed the boys. They could perceive
that they were in a sort of natural man-trap.</p>

<p class='c006'>This sense of uneasiness increased as, their
first rapid glance over, they observed details. In
front of one of the tents was seated a tall, lanky
figure, dressed in rough mackinack trousers, calf
skin boots, a blue shirt open to expose a sinewy
throat, and, to crown all, a battered sombrero.
This man was seated on an old soap box and
strumming on a banjo as they entered the glade.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the sound of footsteps he looked up and
showed a dark, high-cheek-boned face with a
thin, hawk-like nose, and a pair of piercing,
steely-gray eyes. The man was clean shaven and
his lips were thin, close-pressed, and cruel. This
countenance was framed in a mass of lank, black
hair, so long that it hung down to the shoulders
of his faded shirt.</p>

<p class='c006'>The figure, its occupation, and the previous incidents
of the adventure all combined to form an
intuition which suddenly flashed with convincing
force into Tom’s mind:</p>

<p class='c006'>This place was the hidden camp of the Chinese
runners, and the figure on the soap box was
Bully Banjo—the feared and admired Simon
Lake himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Right smart work, by Chowder!” he exclaimed,
setting aside his banjo and rising on
his long, thin limbs as the boys and Fu were
marched into his presence. His voice was as thin,
sharp, and penetrating as his eyes, and was unmistakably
that of a downeaster. In fact, Simon
Lake was a native of Nantucket. From whaling
he had drifted to sealing. From sealing to seal
poaching in the Aleutian, and from that it was but
a step to his present employment. A shudder that
they could not suppress ran through the boys as
they realized that they were in the presence of

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br />IN THE GRIP OF SIMON LAKE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But Simon Lake’s voice, setting aside its rasping
natural inflection, was mild enough as he addressed
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wa-al, boys, yer see thet I’ve got a smart long
arm.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’d like to know by what right you’ve had
us brought here in this fashion,” broke out Tom
indignantly. “We’re not interfering with you.
Why, then, can’t you leave us alone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jes’ cos I want er bit uv infermation frum
yer,” rejoined Simon easily. He leaned down and
picked up a bit of wood. Then, drawing a knife,
he shaped it to a toothpick and thrust it in his
mouth. During the pause the boys noticed that
several rough-looking men had sauntered up from
various positions about the camp. Among them
was one short, stocky man, who might have been
the thickset man of the boat the night before.
This individual’s hat was shoved back—for it was
warm and stuffy in this place—exposing a ruddy
stubble of hair. A bristly mustache as coarse as
wire sprouted from his upper lip. This man was
Zeb Hunt, Bully Banjo’s mate when afloat and
chief lieutenant ashore. In some ways he was a
bigger ruffian than his superior.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ez I sed,” resumed Simon Lake, when he had
shaped the pick to his satisfaction, “I want er bit
uv infermation from yer. It ain’t often thet
Simon Lake wants ter know suthin’ thet he kain’t
find out right smart fer hisself. But this yar
time it’s diff’ent. I’m a kalkerlatin’ on you byes
helpin’ me out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A sudden gleam came into those cold, steely
eyes. A flash of warning not to trifle with him,
it seemed. But it died out as suddenly as it had
come, and in his monotonous Yankee drawl, Simon
went on:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ther hull in an’ outs uv it is—how fur hez
Chillingwuth gone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know what you mean,” exclaimed
Tom, who had decided to act as spokesman, and
silenced the impetuous Jack by a look.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes, yer do, boy. Daon’t try ter gilflicker
me. I’m ez smart ez a steel trap, boy, and
ez quick as sixty-’leven, so da-ont rile me up. I’m
askin’ yer ag’in—how fur hez Chillingworth
gone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s anchored down in the cove,” said Tom,
willfully misunderstanding him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again that angry gleam shone in Bully Banjo’s
eyes. His thin lips tightened till they were a
mere slit across his gaunt visage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Daon’t rile me, boy,” he said, in an almost
pleading voice, although Tom was swift to catch
the menace behind it. “Daon’t rile me. Yer seen
thet them I wants I gits. Yer seen thet when
that Chink yonder walked inter yer by the crick.
Speak me true, bye, an’ speak me fair, an’ yer
kin go on yer way. But ef yer lie—wa-al, by
Juniper, you’ll wish as you wuz dead a hundred
times afore you be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In any event,” said Tom boldly enough, and
without a quiver in his voice, though his scalp
tightened and his heart beat thick and fast at
these words; “in any event, if you think you can
carry out any such high-handed piece of business
as this without suffering for it, you’re badly mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Simon Lake laughed. His mirth was not pleasant
to hear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re in the twentieth century, recollect,”
added Tom. “There is such a thing as law and
order. Seattle is not so very far away. Port
Townsend, too. There are police there, and the
means to make you suffer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wa-al, d’ye hear thet, Zeb?” asked Bully
Banjo, turning to his mate. “I kinder kalkerlate
thet is ther all-firedest best joke I’ve hearn
since Heck wuz a pup. By Juniper, boy,” he
went on impressively, “ther ain’t no law made kin
touch me. Understand? No law made. They’re
welcome ter try ef they want ter. You kin see
fer yourselves thet nobody wouldn’t find this
place unless they knowed the way, and nobody’s
not never goin’ ter diskiver it ’cept those who I’ve
a mind shall. Na-ow air yer goin’ ter tell me
wot Chillingworth hez done in ther matter of
tryin’ ter bring me up with a short tun?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. I am not,” replied Tom firmly. “That
is Mr. Chillingworth’s business. Why do you ask
us about it? We are only out here as his guests.
We know nothing about your ras——” “Rascality”
Tom was going to say, but thought better
of it and substituted: “Goings on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake smiled unpleasantly. His fingers closed
suggestively around his knife.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yer seem ter cle’n plum everlastingly fergit
thet I kin find out all I want ter know frum
thet Chink thar,” he snapped suddenly, pointing
to Fu, who stood apart with his tall countryman.
The two seemed to be talking earnestly. As Lake
turned, the tall Mongolian hastened toward him.
It was as if he had overheard him, although that
at the distance which he had been standing would
have been impossible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That fellow yonder,” he said, speaking slowly,
but using good English, “that fellow yonder,”
pointing to Fu, “tells me that these boys and their
companions were anchored on a sloop in the cove
last night. They saw the burials and overheard
some of our talk.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake’s face grew black, as if a thundercloud
had settled on it. Zeb Hunt exclaimed angrily.
The men standing about began to mutter. Tom
saw that the frightened Fu must have told everything.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this true?” demanded Lake, turning to the
boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose so,” rejoined Tom doggedly. He
felt a helpless sense that there was no use in
denying it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thet means jes’ so much more ammernition
in Chillingworth’s hands,” mused Lake slowly.
“Consarn him! Why kain’t he fall inter line like
the other ranchers? I don’t hev no trouble with
them. I pay fer what I git, cash daown on the
nail, an’ no questions asked. By Juniper, it’s
funny ter me the way Chillingworth acts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ve got to get the whip hand of him sooner
or later,” struck in Zeb Hunt. “Why not now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How d’ye mean, Zeb?” asked the lanky Bully
Banjo, turning quickly on him as a man who is
ready to grasp at any suggestion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What I mean is jest this: We’ve got these
two kids here and the Chink—though the Chink
don’t count. But don’t yer see thet as long ez
we hold ther kids, we kin dictate terms. Ef
Chillingworth gets cantankerous—biff!—one of
the kids is sniffed out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This amiable plan was proposed in a calm way
that alarmed the boys far more than if vehemence
had been used. They saw that logically to
keep them prisoners was the only thing for the
gang to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, he hung on Simon Lake’s next
words. They were not long in coming.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Zeb,” he said approvingly, “I allers said yer
hed a long haid. Now, by Chowder, I knows it.
Thet’s a right smart idee. Here, Death, and you,
too, Squinty, take charge of these kids, feed ’em
well, but I’ll hold you responsible fer ’em. Take
’em away. I’ll make up my mind later what
we’ll do with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, apparently noticing Tom’s start at the
ominous name of one of the worthies who came
forward at the word of command, the mighty
Bully Banjo condescended to explain:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Death’s right name is ‘Death on the Trail’
He’s a Chinook, and ef you cut up any didoes,
ye’ll find he’s well named.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man named Death was a tall, dark-skinned
fellow, clad in a buckskin coat and ragged trousers.
His companion wore mackinacks and cowhide
boots. Both had on ragged sombreros.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on,” said Death, motioning to the boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>Squinty said nothing, but his crossed eyes
glinted malevolently as he produced two coils of
rawhide rope.</p>

<p class='c006'>Boiling with indignation and likewise considerably
alarmed, the two boys had to submit to the
indignity of being tied in the ropes till they resembled
two packages bound securely round and
round with twine. Like lifeless packages, too,
they were presently picked up and helplessly borne
toward the rear of the camp.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cliff face towered for some distance above
the base of the narrow valley at this point, and
at its foot the boys, as they were bundled along,
noticed a dark fissure. Tom judged it to be the
mouth of a cave. He was right. And in a few
minutes he learned also that it was to fulfill another
purpose—that of a prison.</p>

<p class='c006'>Death and Squinty set down their burdens at
the entrance, and then rolled them inside just as
if they had been bales of inanimate goods of some
kind. The boys’ feelings were not soothed by the
fact that fully a score of chattering, grinning
Chinese watched the operation. These fellows
were quartered back of the camp, and evidently
formed a part of the consignment brought in on
the schooner the night before.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cave did not extend very far back in the
rock face, and was narrow and low. But there
was plenty of room in its narrow confines for
two lads, bound as they were. Their two jailers
shoved them as far in as possible and then without
a word left them. Or so it seemed, but Tom’s
eyes—about the only part of his body he could
move—presently lit on a motionless figure sitting
smoking on a rock near the cave entrance.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Death. A long rifle across his knees
showed that he was acting as sentinel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jack, old boy,” said Tom, at length, “how are
you coming along?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As well as can be expected, as they say when
a fellow’s been given up for dead and buried,”
chuckled Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>His tone and words cheered Tom mightily.
His brother, then, still retained his spirits, and
hopeless as their position seemed that was something.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Looks pretty bad, Tom,” said Jack presently.
“I wish we could have got that medicine through
to uncle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So do I,” agreed Tom. “So far as this imprisonment
is concerned, I imagine they will only
keep us here till they get Chillingworth’s promise
to let up on them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But if he won’t give it?” demanded Jack.
“He didn’t strike me as the kind of man to——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hark!” exclaimed Tom, interrupting him.
“What’s that—music?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Music it was. The strumming of a banjo,
played with consummate skill.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently, too, a voice struck in. It was nasal
and penetrating, offering a sharp contrast to the
real skill of the banjo player:</p>

<div class='nf-block-c0'>
  <div class='nf-block'>
    <p>
    “I sailed away in sixty-four,<br />
    In the Nancy brig from the Yankee shore;<br />

  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br />FAST IN THE TOILS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>An hour or so later the lads were much astonished
when Squinty entered the cave and,
bending over them, rapidly loosened their bonds.
So tightly had they been triced up, however, that
it was some time before the stiffness was sufficiently
out of their limbs to enable them to move
with freedom. While they were “limbering up”
their guardians allowed them to emerge from
the cave and move and chafe their sore, aching
limbs, at liberty. But, although it was pleasant
to feel free once more—so far as their manacles
went, that is—the boys did not by any means relish
the surrounding crowd of Chinamen and
rough-looking white men, the latter of whom indulged
in some coarse jests at their expense.</p>

<p class='c006'>At length, however, they were so far relieved
from their cramped pains and “pins and needles”
that they were able to stand upright and walk
about without much difficulty. As soon as their
guardians saw this they roughly ordered them to
march in front of them toward the tent where
they had had their first sight of Bully Banjo.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was still sitting there as they were escorted
up, and was deep in consultation with the tall
Chinaman and the scrubby-haired man, whom we
know as Zeb Hunt. Apparently the subjects of
the consultation had been the boys, for as Death
and Squinty marched them up Simon Lake looked
up from a stick he had been industriously whittling,
and turned to his companions with a quick
“hush.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal,” said he, as the boys came to a halt,
“you’ve bin doin’s some putty tall thinkin’, I kalkerlate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why,” rejoined Tom boldly, “I guess those
cords were tied a little too tight for our thoughts
to circulate very freely.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He had determined not to let this ruffian see
that he had caused them to fear him—an effect
which he was evidently desirous of producing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Putty good!” chuckled Simon, seemingly
pleased at Tom’s pleasantry. “You’re ez bright
ez a new dollar, bye. Anybody kin see that. But
thet ain’t what I wants ter talk ter yer about.
Wot I wants to know is how you’ll regard a little
proposition I’m goin’ ter make ter yer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom could not check his look of astonishment
at this, while, as for Jack, his eyes seemed to start
out of his head. Lake’s tone had become friendly,
even confidential. But it did not fool either of
the boys for a minute.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What new bit of villainy is he going to
spring?” wondered Tom. Aloud he said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is your proposition?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal,” drawled Lake, “in the fust place, it’s
a chance fer you byes ter make some easy money,
then in the second, it’s a job that won’t require
hardly any work on your parts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what is it?” demanded Tom bluntly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jes’ this,” spoke Simon Lake. “It’s important
fer me ter hev Chillingworth out uv ther way fer
a day er two. Now I want yer to write him a
note at my dictation, telling him ther fix yer in,
an’ askin’ him ter come an’ get yer. You kin tell
him thet we’ve left you prisoners right here or
any other place whar it’ll take him some time to
look yer up.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hardly understand——” began Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then yer ain’t ez bright ez I thought yer,”
snarled Lake. “See here, s’pose you do as I say—waal,
it’ll take Chillingworth a little time ter
find yer, won’t it, pervided you lay low and don’t
go lookin’ fer him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, but——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, in the meantime,” went on Lake, as if
the matter were already settled, “I’ll be putting
through my little bit of business. It will take
me near Chillingworth’s ranch, and I don’t want
him ter be near while it’s going on—savvy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I ‘savvy’ this much,” said Tom indignantly,
“that you wish us to betray our friends so that
you may be able to carry on your illegal business.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake’s brow grew dark and lowering.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thet’s a bad tone ter adopt with me, bud,” he
said slowly, “an’ you ain’t in any position ter dictate
terms ter us—be yer?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not,” struck in Jack, “but just the
same, we aren’t in a position where you are going
to get us to do your dirty work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wow!” howled Zeb Hunt, capering about
and slapping his knees with his big gnarled hands.
“Hear the young turkey gobble. My! ain’t he
a fine young bird.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shet yer mouth, Zeb,” snarled Lake. Zeb
instantly relapsed into silence. Under other circumstances
it would have been amusing to the
boys to notice how suddenly his jaw fell, and
the laugh left his features. Now, however, it
was just the reverse. It demonstrated how thoroughly
the rascal had the members of his band
under his control.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal,” resumed the Yankee slowly, and fixing
his eyes in a cold stare on the boys, “you’ve
hearn what I hed ter say. Thar’s fifty dollars in
it fer yer ef you’ll write the notes. I’d hev writ
’em myself,” he unblushingly went on, “but I
ain’t no hand with a pen, and neither is none of
ther others. ’Tain’t as if ther wuz anything
crooked in et,” he went on persuasively, “it’s jes’
ter keep er man out uv ther way fer a day er two.
I’ll leave yer with plenty of provisions an’ Death
ter look arter you. When yer friends git near
Death he’ll vamoose an’ join me at a place he
knows uv. I’ll be fur away by thet time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You seem to have it all figured out,” said Tom
dryly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yew bate. Us daown easters is right smart
at sich things, by Juniper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s only one thing you have omitted in
your calculations.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s thet, young feller?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That your whole scheme depends on our falling
in with it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, yew do, don’t ye?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not in the longest day you ever lived, Simon
Lake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nor for more money than you ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boys’ answers came like two pistol shots.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake, all pretense at good feeling over now,
jumped to his feet. A look of furious rage came
over his lean features. His gray eyes blazed like
twin points of fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So thet’s yer answer, is it?” he shouted.
“Waal, I’ve bin Simon Lake ter you boys heretofore.
Now, by Chowder, you’ll see ther Bully
Banjo part of me. Here, Death, an’ you, too,
Squinty—take these kids back ter ther cave.
Guard ’em close. I’ll hold you responsible fer
them, an’ heaven hev mercy on yer soul ef they
git away. We’ll see how——”</p>

<p class='c006'>There came a sudden crackling in the brush
behind them. Lake faced round with a motion
swift as a wild cat. Zeb Hunt and one or two of
the others seized their rifles and plunged off into
the underbrush. It was evident that they suspected
that a concealed spy had caused the noise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bring him out,” roared Bully Banjo. “I’ll
use his hide fer a banjo head, by Chowder!”</p>

<p class='c006'>But after a quarter of an hour or so, the others
returned and reported that they had been unable
to find anything. The noise must have been made
by some wild animal they declared. At any rate,
there was no trace of a human being in the undergrowth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much relieved, apparently, Lake ordered the
boys taken off to the cave. A few minutes later
they were once more in their place of captivity.
But this time only their hands and ankles were
manacled. But even had their limbs been free,
it would have been madness even to dream of
escaping, for in front of the cave Death, as remorseless
as his namesake, and the sinister
Squinty kept watch. Squatting on rocks, their
pipes between their teeth and their rifles held
loosely on their knees, not a movement of the boy
prisoners escaped them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Evidently, Bully Banjo’s words were law, to be
carried out to the letter. Such, at least, would
have been gathered from the grim relentless manner
in which Death and his companion mounted
guard over that cave.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of what fate Simon Lake had in store for
them, of course, the boys could not form the remotest
idea, but apparently he meant to keep them
in his power till such time as he was certain that
he could use them as a power against Chillingworth,
whom he rightly felt was the most inexorable
enemy he had among the weak-spirited
ranchers.</p>

<p class='c006'>In low tones Jack and Tom discussed the situation,
and their guards made no objection to their
doing so, apparently. At least, they made no
move to interfere. No doubt the boys were not
watched so closely as grown men would have
been. What could two bound lads do, their
guards reasoned. It was not long before they
were due to have a striking illustration of what
such lads as the Bungalow Boys were capable of.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Tom’s way of thinking, Bully
Banjo would keep them in the cavern till he and
his lieutenants could decide on some way in which
they could be used to keep Chillingworth out of
the way while Lake ran his Chinamen through by
the convenient trail which cut across one corner
of the Chillingworth ranch. Of what this way
was to be they could not, naturally, form any
idea. Possibly, they figured out, it might be by
means of a decoy note.</p>

<p class='c006'>At all events, situated as they were, neither lad
was in a mood to waste time on speculation.
Rather did they devote their mental efforts to
figuring out some way of escape. But, try as
they would, they could think of none.</p>

<p class='c006'>At dusk Squinty was relieved on guard by another
of the band—a man of even more sinister
appearance than he himself,—a fellow with a big
bottle nose and red, inflamed features. He had
the besotted, foolish look of a man who is given
to yielding to a passion for drink. He brought
with him some tin dishes—or rather two tin
bowls, and a pair of tin cups. The former contained
a kind of stew with a big hunk of bread
stuck on one side of the receptacle. The cups
were filled with steaming coffee. The newcomer
and Death silently released the boys’ hands so
that they could eat. While they satisfied their appetites,
which by this time were rather sharp,
Tom wished devoutly that among the “table furnishings”
there had been two knives. He would
have risked the attempt to conceal one of them.
But, to his disappointment, the meal was served
with spoons as the only means of conveying the
eatables to the mouth. So that plan was nipped
in the bud.</p>

<p class='c006'>Death and the red-faced man talked in low
tones while the boys ate. Apparently the latter
was trying to induce the Indian to perform some
service for him which the other was unwilling to
undertake. At last, however, he appeared to
yield, and the boys saw the red-faced individual
slip something that looked like money into the Indian’s
hand. The latter shambled off and shortly
reappeared with a round bottle covered with
wicker, which he handed to the red-faced man.
The bottle appeared to have come from the quarters
of the Chinamen, for that was the direction
in which the Indian had gone on his errand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Supper over, the tin dishes were removed, and
the boys’ hands tied once more. They tried to
ask some questions, but were cut short with
growls from both their guardians. They sat silently
wondering how things were going forward
with their uncle and Mr. Chillingworth, as the
dark rushed on.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before long the canyon was enveloped in a
gray gloom, which presently became black night.
Far above them—seen as if from the bottom of
a pit—were stars, shining brightly, and with an
irritating sense of freedom. The boys had
crawled to the cavern mouth to make these observations,
but Death and his companion forced
them back. As darkness fell, from the camp they
could hear the “Plunk-a-plunka-plunk” of Simon
Lake’s banjo. The rascal’s harsh voice, too,
reached them, crooning out apparently sentimental
songs of the cheap music-hall variety.</p>

<p class='c006'>It grew chilly as the evening wore on. A sea
wind laden with a penetrating dampness swept
up the canyon. It moaned in a dismal fashion in
the black pine woods. Death and the red-nosed
man dragged wood to the cave mouth and made
a fire. When it was kindled they sat by it hugging
their knees, their rifles between their legs,
and staring moodily into the glowing embers.
Every now and then the Indian would rise to get
more wood. At such times he would take a perfunctory
glance into the cave to see how his
charges were faring.</p>

<p class='c006'>When he did this the red-nosed took advantage
of the other’s back being turned to raise the
bottle to his lips and take a long draught. Presently
he offered the bottle to the Indian. The
Chinook silently took a long drink and handed it
back. This performance was repeated several
times.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the time the last tinkle of the plaintive banjo
had died out and silence reigned among the chattering
Chinamen, both the Indian and the red-nosed
man appeared to have difficulty in keeping
awake. Presently the latter began to nod. He
dozed off two or three times, awakening with a
start. Before long he was off in real earnest.
His head lolled forward on his chest, his mouth
flopped open supinely. He lurched down, huddled
in a heap, a degrading spectacle. The potent
effect of what he had consumed overcame the Indian
more slowly. Before he gave himself up to
sleep, in fact, he entered the cave and felt the
boys’ ropes carefully. Then apparently, to make
sure they were all secure, he strode off toward
the main camp and presently returned with more
rope. With this he made additional thongs. Then
with a grunt of satisfaction he left the cave, and,
after a cautious look about him, he, too, laid himself
down in front of the fire and presently his
wary, beady eyes closed. The Chinese liquor,
strong, sleep-inducing, and wit-benumbing, had
overtaken him, too.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, if only we had a knife,” sighed Tom, “we
could make a dash for it now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You bet we would,” cried Jack. “All they
could do would be to fire after us, and they’d
stand little chance of hitting us in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, no good wishing,” sighed Tom. “Here
we are now, tied up tighter than ever, and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>A small stone fell in front of the cave. In the
silence, broken only by the murmur of the stream
and the sighing of the wind in the pines it
sounded as startlingly loud as a rifle shot. Presently
another fell.</p>

<p class='c006'>Could it be a signal of some kind?</p>

<p class='c006'>But suppose it was—who could it be? Certainly
not Mr. Chillingworth or the boys’ uncle,
or——</p>

<p class='c006'>At this point of Tom’s meditations another
small stone fell. There could no longer be any
doubt. Somebody on the cliff above was trying
to attract their attention. But there did not seem
to be any way of showing him that they heard
and understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once, both boys, who had been painfully
wiggling toward the front of the cave—moving
with difficulty in their tight bonds—gave a surprised
gasp.</p>

<p class='c006'>Something that at first glance seemed like a
strand of spider’s web, with an immense spider
hanging on the end of it, was swinging in the
cave mouth, between them and the red glow of
the dying watch fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it was not a spider, nor a web. It was a
thin string, and as Tom struggled to the front of
the cave and neared the object dangling at the
end of the cord, he almost fell backward with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was an opened clasp-knife.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c007'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br />IN DIRE STRAITS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Moving with the utmost caution so as not to
arouse the sleeping Indian, Tom attempted to
reach the knife with his bound hands. But he
found this impossible to do. After a dozen efforts
he realized that it was hopeless. It began to
look as if their unknown benefactor might have
striven in vain to aid them. But Tom’s mind was
not one to be overcome by an obstacle, however
insurmountable it might seem at first blush.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reaching forward—like a boy playing bob-cherry—he
seized the knife with his teeth. Tom’s
ivories were white and strong and even, and holding
the keen blade in his mouth he had no difficulty
in sawing Jack’s hands free, for the younger
boy had instantly perceived, without Tom’s telling
him, what the other was about to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course, the thing took longer to perform
than it does to tell it here. A dozen times or more
the boys interrupted themselves to look cautiously
around. For all they knew there might be other
guards than the sleeping Indian and his companion.
But they could see none, and, as the
moments went on without interruption, they grew
bolder and worked more rapidly. Presently Jack
was free, and, taking the knife from Tom, he at
once accomplished his brother’s disentanglement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are we going to do now?” whispered
Jack, as they stood cramped and aching, but
thrilling at the same time with the sense of glorious
liberty. But they were by no means at the
end of their troubles yet. They had still to get
out of the cave and make their way to some place
of security beyond Bully Banjo’s immediate grip.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom did not answer Jack’s question immediately.
Instead, he paused and an expression of
deep thought came over his countenance. One
by one, he ran over the various features of the
locality as he recalled them. The high-sided
canyon, steep as the walls of a house, and with
no apparent way of reaching the summit from
below. No, there was no chance of getting away
there. The river? Ah, that was better. Tom
thought that by working along the edge of the
stream they could reach the sea coast, or at least
some point at which they could clamber back onto
the trail,—possibly at the same place as that by
which they had made their unfortunate excursion
after water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rapidly and in a low whisper he conveyed
his plan to Jack. The younger boy nodded, and
then, as there was nothing to be gained by waiting,
they started to put the daring plan into execution.
But as they moved forward out of the
cave Death, who, like most Indians slumbered as
lightly as a cat, stirred and opened his eyes. In
a flash, he saw what had happened and comprehended
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Luckily, before he cried out to give the alarm,
he reached for his rifle, which lay by his side.
That instant of time was all that Tom needed.
In one bound he was on the Chinook. The fellow
reeled backward under his powerful blow, toppling
head first into the still glowing fire. Before
he could utter a cry, though, Tom was on
him. The Bungalow Boy’s hand was clapped
over the Indian’s mouth. But Tom speedily
found that, though his swift attack had temporarily
made him master of the situation, he was
no more than a fair match for the Indian. The
fellow was thin, but as tough as steel wire. He
wriggled and squirmed like an acrobat under
Tom’s powerful grip. Fortunately, all this rolling
and thrashing about brought them out of the
embers, or one or the other might have been
badly burned.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Jack who turned the balance in favor
of Tom. He saw as soon as Tom sprang on the
Indian that the latter was likely to prove a pretty
handy man in a rough and tumble encounter, and
therefore he had lost no time in dashing back into
the cave and securing some of the ropes with
which they themselves had been secured but a
few moments before.</p>

<p class='c006'>He returned just as the Indian, by dint of arching
his back, had succeeded in momentarily casting
off Tom’s grip. The Bungalow Boy, taken
by surprise by the sudden spring-like upbound of
the Indian, was cast clear off him, in fact. But
before the Indian could take any advantage of
this turn of affairs, Jack was on him. The
younger Dacre boy seized the leathery-faced old
rascal by the head and clapped one hand over his
mouth. He realized that the most important thing
to do was to keep the man from calling out and
alarming the camp. Tom speedily recovered himself,
and, coming to Jack’s aid, it was not long
before they had the Chinook as securely tied and
bound as they themselves had been. Ripping off
a portion of his blue-flannel shirt, Tom stuffed it
in the fellow’s mouth to serve as a gag. They
then bundled him into the cave and started for
the river. There was no difficulty in locating it.
The roar of its dashing waters as they rushed on
to the sea betrayed its whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, unfortunately, during the battle something
had occurred which they had not foreseen.
The red-faced man had slumbered serenely
through it all. But, unseen by either of the boys
during the struggle in the embers, a glowing
brand had been cast upon his clothes. This had
burned steadily on, fanned by the wind which
swept through the canyon. Just as the boys vanished
in the black shadows toward the river, the
smoldering flame reached his flesh. With a yell,
he wakened, on the alert in an instant, his slumber
having cleared his fuddled brain of the effects
of his carouse.</p>

<p class='c006'>It took him scarcely a longer time than it had
the Indian to perceive what had occurred. His
first yell of pain had aroused the camp. Before
the befuddled, red-faced individual had regained
his wits entirely, the place was humming like an
angry beehive.</p>

<p class='c006'>With long-legged leaps, Simon Lake came
bounding into the circle of light formed by the
scattered embers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What in tarnation’s the matter, Tarbox, yer
red-faced codfish?” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Matter enough,” roared back Zeb Hunt, who
had been doing some rapid investigating. “Them
boys has got away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Got away!” echoed Simon Lake furiously, yet
incredulously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yep. Death’s trussed up like a Christmas
turkey back thar in ther cave, an’ ther young
varmints hes vamoosed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Scatter, boys! After ’em!” bellowed Lake.
“By Juniper, I’ll give a hundred dollars to the
one that gets ’em.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alive or dead?” asked one ruffian, with an
ugly scar running from brow to chin down his
weather-beaten face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” snarled Lake, “alive or dead. They
know too much fer me ter lose ’em now. And
then if they git loose all our plans go ter tarnation
smash. Go on, Zeb, arter ’em. Git on the
scent, my bullies. As for you,” grated out Lake,
casting a terrible look at poor Tarbox, who had
succeeded in extinguishing his clothes, “I’ll attend
to you later.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The fellow sank to his knees and began quivering
out pleas for mercy. But Lake turned away
with a savage laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ll blubber worse then that afor I git
through with yer, by Chowder!”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke, from the direction of the river
there came a sudden loud crack as if a branch
had snapped under some one’s foot. Lake heard
it, and was quick to guess its significance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ther young varmits is in ther brush yonder,
byes. Git ’em out. Arter ’em. Drag ’em out of
thar!”</p>

<p class='c006'>It sounded like the master of a pack of hounds
urging on his charges to their work. In obedience
to Bully Banjo’s shout and cries the searchers
plunged into the brush, shouting and yelling
to one another savagely.</p>

<p class='c006'>Simon Lake was right when he imagined that
the sudden sharp noise in the brush had been
caused by the boys. It was Jack’s unlucky encounter
with a dead limb half buried in dried
leaves and debris that had caused it. The accident
could not possibly have occurred at a more
unfortunate moment for the boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>Gritty lads as they were, both of them changed
color and their pulses began to beat a tattoo as
they heard the human bloodhounds break into
full cry at the sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tom, I’m—I’m awfully sorry,” gasped Jack
contritely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rubbish, old fellow. How could you help it?”
rejoined Tom. “Come on, we’ll beat them yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The question seemed a natural one. They were
still some little distance from the river, in the
midst of thick underbrush through which it was
hard to proceed quickly without making a noise.
The outlaws, on the other hand, probably knew
of trails to the river bank. They might thread
these quickly and arrive there ahead of the boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>But they kept doggedly on. Tom had given no
answer to Jack’s question. Time was too precious
for that now, and breath, too. The great object
was to reach the river bank first. Tom felt that
once among its rugged rocks and intricate windings,
interspersed as they were by dense brakes
of brush, that they would stand at least a chance
of getting away unobserved.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now they reached the river bank.
Through the darkness they could see the water
rushing whitely along. In the midst of the white
smother in front of them could be seen a darker
blot. Tom guessed it to be a rock in mid-stream.</p>

<p class='c006'>As he saw it a bold idea flashed into his mind.
If they could jump and gain it, perhaps there was
another rock beyond to which they could jump in
turn, and so cross the stream and reach the other
side in safety. In a few low breathless words he
confided his plan to Jack. The younger boy, however,
was not impressed by it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s all right for you, with your record for
the broad jump, Tom,” he argued. “You could
make it. But I don’t believe I could, and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a sudden crackling and trampling
in the brush behind them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here they come,” exclaimed Tom. “It’s now
or never. Are we going to try for it or wait
here to be roped like two fool calves?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jack drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll try it,” he said, gritting his teeth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good boy!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom’s hand fell with a tight squeeze on the
younger lad’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ll make it, never fear, Jack,” he went on
encouragingly, as he threw off his coat and
stepped back from the bank as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll go first, and if I can make it, I’ll be on
the rock to help you when you come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But if you miss?” quavered Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But I won’t miss,” said Tom pluckily, although
he felt by no means certain in his own
mind. “I feel as confident as I did that day at
Audubon when I got the broad jump away from
Old Hickey. He——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This way, boys. I hearn the varmints not a
second ago!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The voice, raucous and savage, came behind
them. Its owner was still in the brush. They
could hear his heavy-footed tramplings. But it
warned them that the moment for action had arrived.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a quick run, Tom reached the bank of
the stream. Then up he shot and outward over
the boiling, screaming waters, and—landed on
the rock with six inches or more to spare. The
great stone was wet and slippery, but he maintained
his footing, and turned with a wave toward
the shore.</p>

<p class='c006'>As he did so a terrible fear shot into his heart.
What if Jack’s nerve failed him at the last instant?
Situated as Tom was, he would be powerless
to help him, for to leap back to shore again
would be an impossibility. Shout encouragement
he dared not. All he could do was to wait, with
the river roaring in the blackness all about him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly ashore the night was split by a red
flash and a sharp report sounded above the turmoil.
Jack had been sighted and they were firing
at him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Jack, why won’t you jump?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The words were wrung from the Bungalow
Boy as he stood upright on the wet rock, the spray
of the racing river showering him till he was as
drenched as his foothold. With burning eyes, he
peered shoreward.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly over the water toward him came a
figure. It was Jack. As he leaped three shots
resounded behind him. Tom could feel the bullets
whistle by. But they hardly arrived quicker than
Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was well for him that Tom was there, for
Jack’s jump was short. He fell, clutching at the
wet rock. The water seized his legs and tried to
whip him off in its mad current. But Tom’s
strong hands had grasped his brother’s wrists before
his hold gave way, and in less time than it
takes to tell it Jack was beside him on the rock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank goodness, you’re safe,” breathed the
elder lad, as Jack, panting, wet, and trembling
from his exertion, stood beside him.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no time to exchange more words.
As Tom spoke, several bullets came whizzing
about them. Two or three hit the rock with a
dull “pinging” sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>Evidently their refuge had been spied from the
shore and a better target than they presented it
would be hard to imagine. So far the darkness
had apparently intervened in their favor. Tom
knew it would not protect them for long. Presently
the men on shore would get the range.</p>

<p class='c006'>He dragged Jack down till both lay flat on the
rock, and together they slowly made their way
across it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Was there another such rock within jumping
distance?</p>

<p class='c006'>If there were not, the Bungalow Boys were in
the most dangerous position they had ever occupied
in their adventurous lives.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br />A LEAP FOR LIFE AND FREEDOM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Proceeding thus, with their hearts almost literally
in their mouths and with nerves that
throbbed painfully, the boys finally reached the
side of the rock removed from the shore. To
Tom’s huge delight, they found here, lighted
dimly by a reflection from the white foam, a little
ledge. By standing on this crouching as
low as possible they would be safe enough from
the bullets—that is, except one or more of the
outlaws leaped to the rock. But this was extremely
doubtful.</p>

<p class='c006'>If two active boys like Tom and Jack Dacre
had had great difficulty in doing so, it was hardly
likely that the outlaws, men of irregular lives
and clumsy movements, would be able to accomplish
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>A howl of surprise greeted the first knowledge
the men on shore had of the disappearance of the
boys, which came when their figures suddenly
vanished from the rock. The general consensus
of opinion following that was that they had fallen
off and been swept to death in the swift current.</p>

<p class='c006'>But an old fox like Bully Banjo was not the
sort of man to leave the bank on that account.
On the contrary, he determined to wait till daylight
if necessary, and at that time he settled
within himself, he would make certain if the boys
had really drowned or if they had only found a
spot on the rock where they could not be seen
from the shore.</p>

<p class='c006'>He ordered no move, but that the rock was
to be watched, however. And so, in silent, dogged
determination, the outlaws sat down to await
the coming of the day. At last it began to grow
faintly, dimly light. A nebulous chilly glow diffused
itself through the canyon, bringing out its
rough walls and their ragged, towering groups of
pines and other conifers.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the coming of day the men on the shore
began to stir. Parties walked off along the rim
of the stream in either direction, their purpose
being to find, if possible, some trace of the boys.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime, the coming of the light had
not, as Tom had hoped, revealed another rock between
the one on which they stood and the shore.
Instead, thirty feet or more of raging and, apparently,
deep water lay between them and the
other bank. It was impossible to jump it and already
they were growing weak and faint from
exposure and suspense.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ledge was narrow, too, and slippery, and
it was no small exertion in itself to keep a foothold
on it for the length of time to which the
lads had clung there. Both of them felt that they
had almost reached the limit of their endurance.
But neither of them wanted to admit it just then.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I reckon they think ashore that we have
drowned,” said Tom, at length, rightly fathoming
the surmises of Simon Lake’s men. “If they
knew what a fix we are in, they would start peppering
again, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To tell the truth,” said Jack, “I don’t see that
we are in a much better position than we would
be if we were ashore. We can tell by the voices
that Lake’s men are on watch for us. If we show
ourselves, it will be the signal for a fusillade.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t think so,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, why not? They have us at their
mercy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is just it,” responded Tom soberly. “As
soon as we show ourselves, they will, of course,
know that we are not drowned. That being the
case, all they have got to do is to keep the rock
covered. Why, if they want to, they could keep
us here till starvation finishes us off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unless we swim for it,” put in Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Swim for it?” Tom laughed grimly, and
pointed to the water about them. “How long
could a fellow last in that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’d try it before I’d give Lake the satisfaction
of starving us out,” responded Jack
grittily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Same here,” replied Tom, “but I’ve got another
plan in my head. The only thing is I don’t
know if the means for working it out will come
along before we drop off here from starvation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t mean that you’ve figured out a way
of getting off here?” gasped Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have,” rejoined Tom, “but it’s a very remote
chance that it will be successful. It depends on
so many things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Say,” demanded Jack, “you’re not thinking of
trying the jump to the other bank—you’d never
make it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know that. So we’ll just hang on here and
wait for the one chance in a hundred that I’m
looking for.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that is——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you’ve noticed the logs that have been
drifting by since it’s got daylight?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, some of them have come quite close to
this rock. If the worst comes to the worst——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s done that already,” interrupted Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I agree with you. But why couldn’t we grab
one and trust to luck to its floating us out of
here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jack gave a delighted cry. The water was
roaring so loud that it was not necessary to observe
caution about noise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tom, old fellow, you are a wonder!” he exclaimed.
“Why on earth didn’t I think of that?
It’s the very thing if——”</p>

<p class='c006'>His face grew suddenly sober as he thought
how much depended on that “if.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If the one chance in a hundred happens,” said
Tom, gazing steadily up stream, “and, Jack, old
boy, I believe that it is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look up yonder, what’s that coming down the
river?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Looks like a whole tree. It must have been
uprooted in a freshet. Yes—it is a tree.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, it isn’t, either.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jack looked at his brother in some amazement,
but despite the seriousness of their predicament,
he could not help smiling as the other went on:</p>

<p class='c006'>“If things go right, that’s our boat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Breathlessly they watched the drifting tree as
it was borne toward them on the crest of the
current. It was a fairly large one, with a mass of
roots sticking up at one end. Despite its size,
the stream was carrying it along as if it had been
a straw.</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost before they knew it, the trunk was
within a few feet of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When I shout, don’t hesitate,” warned Tom,
“for we’ll only have a second in which to act, and
it’s our only chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jack nodded. With beating hearts and dry
mouths, they watched the oncoming trunk. Suddenly
it was borne off toward the other bank,
out of all reach. A groan from Jack. But an
eddy caught it the next instant and sent it hurling
back again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s driving straight for us,” whispered Jack
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom said nothing, but nodded to show he
heard.</p>

<p class='c006'>On came the tree, but as it was within a hand’s
breadth of the rock, another eddy caught it and
sent it staggering off again toward the other
bank. But the boys were not going to be defeated
by such an accident as that.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bracing themselves, but still crouching so that
their heads did not show above the rock, they
jumped and landed in the tangle of roots. But,
as might have been expected, their sudden weight
had the effect of rolling the tree over. Submerged
in the boiling current the two boys were
hurried along.</p>

<p class='c006'>Neither of them could tell you to this day how
they escaped drowning, but they did.</p>

<p class='c006'>Breathless, bruised, and with their clothes half
torn from their backs, they succeeded in crawling
around the roots till their heads were above the
water. Helping each other, they struggled like
two half-drowned flies till they succeeded in
throwing themselves across the log so that it
would not tip over completely. From time to time,
though, it gave a lurch that threatened to topple
them off altogether.</p>

<p class='c006'>And so, half in and half out of the water, they
shot from behind the shelter of the rock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ther they be!” the shout went up from the
shore, as Zeb Hunt’s sharp eyes espied the two
clinging, half-submerged figures.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The foxy young varmints! Let ’em hev it,
byes!” yelled Simon Lake furiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as the rifles were aimed, the tree was
swung almost completely around by a sudden
swing of the current, and the boys were borne
out of range. The thick tangle of the roots hid
them from the marksmen ashore.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next instant, however, the capricious
stream swung the log about once more. Instantly
the white, racing water was flecked with
bullets. Splinters from the ones which struck the
tree showered about the boys. But either owing
to the excitement of the riflemen, or to the erratic
motions of the tree as it was tumbled along by
the current, none of the bullets injured them. The
next minute they would have been round a bend
in the stream and safe from the rifles—at least,
temporarily, when something occurred that made
their hearts sink like lead.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tree, which had been hitherto borne swiftly
along, although in an eccentric course, grated,
bumped, and then came to a stop.</p>

<p class='c006'>A triumphant yell went up from the watchers
on the shore as they saw it. They came running
along the bank so as to pour in their fire from
a position exactly opposite to the stranded tree.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Quick, get round to the other side,” choked
out Tom, blowing a stream of water out of his
mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hand over hand among the roots, the lads at
last succeeded in gaining the other side of the
trunk. This put a thick barricade of solid timber
between themselves and the riflemen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now put your foot in the water and shove,”
ordered Tom, suiting the action to the word.
“This log is only stuck on a shoal. I think we
can get her over if we try hard.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They shoved till their muscles cracked, and at
last, partly by their efforts and partly by the
weight of the dammed-up water behind it, the
great log quivered and then moved on.</p>

<p class='c006'>This time it plunged into a deep, rapid pool
that soon hurried it on, and almost before the
boys knew it the shouts and shots behind them
grew faint and then fainter, and finally died out
altogether. Then, and only then, did they dare
to raise themselves from their uncomfortable,
not to say perilous, nooks among the roots and
look out.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first object Tom’s eyes fell upon was one
calculated to make him withdraw his head instantly,
like a turtle retreating into his shell.</p>

<p class='c006'>The stream narrowed just ahead of them and
roared between two walls of rock. On the summit
of one of these rocks, standing where they
must pass directly under him, was the sharply
silhouetted figure of a man.</p>

<p class='c006'>In his hands he grasped a rifle, seemingly ready
for immediate action.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br />SAM HARTLEY TURNS UP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If the figure proved to be one of the outposts
of Simon Lake’s camp, the situation was a serious
one. In a few moments the big tree would
reach the narrow passage in the rocks. When it
did, two courses were open to the boys. One was
to stick to it and throw themselves and their fate
upon providence, or else make a leap for the rocks
which were seamed and scarred. But in the
event of the motionless figure on the rock proving
to be an enemy, their position would be as
bad as before. Unarmed as they were, they
would certainly have to give in without a struggle.</p>

<p class='c006'>But just as Tom had about decided that their
best plan would be to cling to the tree and trust
to luck to get safely through the narrow “gate,”
something familiar struck him about the figure.
It was that of a sun-burned man of middle age,
clean-shaven, and with a conveying sense of
alertness in his erect pose. He wore khaki trousers,
much the worse for wear, stout hunting
boots, laced up almost to his knees, a rough blue
shirt, and a big sombrero.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a flash it came across Tom where they had
seen that figure before.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another instant made the conviction a certainty.</p>

<p class='c006'>The man was Sam Hartley. If any question
had remained of it, all doubt was once and for
all removed, as Tom decided to risk a mistake
and hailed the man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sam! Oh, Sam!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The man on the rock started. His rifle, which
had come up to his arm pit as the boy hailed, fell
back. He stared before him intently as the tree
came bumping at the rock. Before he could recover
himself, from amid its roots two active
young forms had leaped and hurled themselves
straight at the stalwart figure of the former arch
enemy of the counterfeiters of Saw Mill Valley.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Sam, as Tom stopped
wringing his hand for an instant. “It is you, all
right. I thought I was pretty sure of you when
I peeked into Bully Banjo’s camp yesterday when
he had you on the carpet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But, Sam,” cried Tom excitedly, “what are
you doing here, and——” He broke off as a sudden
explanation of the mysterious arrival of the
knife flashed across him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was you that lowered that knife!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure,” said Sam easily; “but, say, boys, we’re
in a bad place right here. Let’s get back in the
brush. I’ve got some grub there and a clean
shirt apiece for you. I guess you’re in need of
both,” he went on, with a smile, surveying the two
dilapidated young figures.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right. Especially the grub part of it,”
laughed Tom. “But, Sam, I can’t get over the
mystery of it. You being here and arriving just
in time to help us out of what seemed such a
dickens of a mess.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet it was simple enough as Sam explained to
them a few moments later. He had been in Seattle
when Mr. Chillingworth’s letter reached the
Secret Service Department in Washington. His
chief at the capital city had at once wired him
in cipher to drop the case he was on and proceed
with all haste to the neighborhood of the
Chillingworth ranch.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the guise of a prospector, Sam had been in
the hills for some days, and, by a stroke of luck,
he had encountered the day before the trail of
the men he was after. An unlucky slip had betrayed
his presence in the brush. It was that
disturbance, it will be recalled, that had so excited
Bully Banjo and his men.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had seen and heard enough from his place
of concealment, however, to know that two boys
were in trouble, and it was no part of Sam Hartley’s
nature not to try and help them. From various
points of vantage among the rocks and
trees on the cliffside he had watched all that had
taken place subsequently in the camp of Bully
Banjo.</p>

<p class='c006'>After revolving one or two plans of rescue, it
had occurred to him that his best plan would be to
lower the knife, which the boys had put to such
excellent use. From his eyrie high up on the
cliffside above the cavern, he had later heard the
shots at the river edge, and had surmised what
was taking place. He had concluded, though,
that the boys had been shot and killed as they
reached the water, and had left the place while
it was still dark, with a heavy heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>What he had seen had enraged him still more
against the men he had been sent to track, and
he had made all haste back to his camp which
was back of the “gate” in the rocks. It had occurred
to him after his arrival there, though, that
in the event of the boys having been killed their
bodies might be carried down by the current. He
had therefore posted himself by the narrow gateway
in order to watch for them. His amazement
when he encountered the Bungalow Boys safe and
sound on their queer raft was only equaled by his
delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the readers of the “Bungalow Boys,” the
first volume of this series, Sam Hartley will need
no further introduction. Our other readers may
be informed, however, that Sam was one of the
“star men” of the Secret Service bureau in Washington,
and that the boys had made his acquaintance
at the Maine bungalow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sam, in disguise, was there for the purpose of
getting evidence against the Trullibers in much
the same manner as he was now after the defiant
Bully Banjo. It will be recalled by our old readers
that the boys had been of great service to
Sam Hartley, aiding him in running down the
Trullibers, and that he in his turn had been able
to do them some services. How glad they were
to meet each other once more under such odd—yet
such entirely natural circumstances, when
they came to be explained—may be better imagined
than detailed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And now,” said Sam, when all had been said
and explained, and the boys’ hunger fully satisfied,
“what are you lads going to do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Push on to the ranch, of course,” declared
Tom. “It is important that we should get the
medicines for Mr. Dacre without delay.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I agree with you,” said Sam, “and as it’s not
much use my trailing those fellows any more—they’ll
be away from there by now—I’ll go with
you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But then you’ll lose them altogether,” exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sam laughed his light, cheery laugh.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No fear of that, boy,” he said. “I know
where their schooner is, and I’ll get them yet, just
keep tabs of that. In any event, I don’t want to
be in any hurry. I’m going to give this Bully
Banjo all the rope he wants, and then round him
and his gang up when he least expects it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All by yourself?” asked Jack amazedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sam laughed again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, hardly,” he said. “It will take a dozen
or more of us to handle that job when the time
comes. But in the meantime I don’t want to give
him any idea that he is being watched or that
the Secret Service is after him. That’s the way
we always do things—wait till we are ready and
the plum’s right for picking, and then go and get
it with neatness and dispatch.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s why you didn’t let Mr. Chillingworth
know you were in the vicinity, then?” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s it,” agreed Sam Hartley. “You see, I
figured that they were likely to be watching his
place, and so I gave it a wide berth. But I guess
there’s no harm in showing myself to him now.
It’s evident that Bully Banjo doesn’t fear anything,
or he’d not be running the Chinks through
so boldly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sam walked off into the brush a little way and
soon reappeared with a small burro. Helped by
the boys, he loaded his cooking utensils and other
camping apparatus on the little creature’s back
and then they set off through the brush, headed
for a trail of which Sam knew. It was characteristic
of Sam Hartley that already he was more
familiar with the country about than most of the
ranchers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s one thing that puzzles me, though,”
he said, “and that is how those fellows ever get
into the canyon yonder from the sea.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why they come in by a trail, don’t they?”
asked Jack innocently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no they don’t, for I watched them pretty
sharply. I’m willing to swear that they didn’t
come in by any trail. No, sir,” grunted Sam,
with an air of conviction. “Either those rascals
have an airship or else they travel under ground.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, they haven’t got an airship, that’s certain,”
laughed Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” agreed the detective; “therefore,
they come under the ridge of hills that separates
the canyon from the sea. But how—well,
I’ll tell you,” he went on, without waiting for
the boys to speak. “My theory is that this river
burrows its way under that ridge, and that the
rascals have some sort of a tunnel there they get
through.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you really think so?” asked Tom, rather
frankly incredulous.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do. It sounds wild, I admit, but how else
are you to account for it. After all, there’s nothing
very uncommon in rivers running under a
range of hills. Why’s there’s one does it right
up at my old home in New York State, and in
California, and all through the west there are
any amount of such waterways. The only real
novelty in it is the fact that these rascals have
been able to use it as a short cut to this canyon.
At any rate, I’m going to explore it some day
when I get time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And shut them off from it?” asked Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, it might come in handy to use as a
trap,” mused Sam Hartley. “But it’s no use figuring
so far ahead till we know if there is such
a thing in existence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” agreed the boys, and for some
time after that they were far too busy getting
through the close-growing brush to do much
talking. At last they emerged, as Sam had foretold
they would, on a rough trail, not unlike the
one by which they had traveled into so much unlooked-for
trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, then,” said Sam, “the next thing is to
locate the Chillingworth ranch. We can’t be so
awfully far from it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How are we ever going to get a line on it,”
wondered Jack, “I’m all twisted about now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Tom who had observed Sam Hartley’s way
of doing things on more than one previous occasion,
said nothing. He just watched Sam as
the latter tied the burro to a tree, and then, diving
into the pocket of his mackintosh coat, produced
a map. From its grimy condition it seemed
to have been well handled. Along the edges of
the folds it was torn by much folding and unfolding.</p>

<p class='c006'>Selecting a flat rock, Sam spread the map out
and the boys saw that it was a rough “sketch,”
one drawn with pen and ink. Several places on
it were marked in red ink. Sam laid a finger on
one of these and remarked briefly:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Chillingworth’s.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see how that helps,” began Jack, but
a look from Tom stopped him, and presently he
was glad he had not said more, for Sam produced
a compass and a pair of parallel rulers. Gazing
carefully over the map, he picked out a spot
which he said was approximately the one on
which they then stood. He then laid the rulers
from that spot to the red-inked portion of the
map representing Mr. Chillingworth’s place.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A straight course, almost due northeast from
here, and we’ll hit it,” he decided, folding the rulers
and putting them carefully away. Then he
methodically replaced the map in its envelope.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few minutes later they set out on the course
Sam had outlined. He planned to travel across
country, the sure-footed burro being as much at
home on the rough mountainside as on a trail.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lay hold of the ropes at the side of the pack
if you get tired,” he advised the boys. “You’ll
find it helps a lot.”</p>

<p class='c006'>After an hour’s traveling, of a sort to which
they had never been accustomed, the boys were
glad to accept this advice, and found themselves
greatly aided.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their way lay over bowlder-strewn ground,
under towering columnar trunks of great trees
of the pine tribe. The lofty conifers entwined
their dark branches high in the air, making the
forest floor beneath cool and dim.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was noon when Sam Hartley, consulting map
and compass once more, struck off to the east.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We ought to be there in ten minutes,” he said,
without a trace of hesitation in his tone. A sea
captain could not have been more confident of
bringing his vessel across the ocean into a designated
port than Sam was of landing in the exact
spot for which he had laid his calculations.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a matter of fact, it was half an hour before
they emerged from the pine woods into a
clearing littered with stumps and blackened
trunks. Before them was a half-grown corn field,
and traces of cultivation were all about them. In
a roughly fenced pasture lot—cleared like the rest
from the virgin forest—were some cattle and
horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Across the corn field could be seen a long, low
house of logs, with a rough-shingled roof. A
little distance from it were some barns painted a
dull red and made of undressed lumber, and a big
corral with a hay stack in the center of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they struck out, skirting the edge of the
corn field, toward the house, the death-like quiet
that had reigned about it was ruefully broken.
From behind one of the barns there suddenly
emerged a blue-bloused figure from whose head
a pigtail stuck out behind as it flew along. Hardly
had the new arrivals taken in this, before, behind
the Chinaman, came a second figure, that of a
woman in a blue sun bonnet and a pink print
dress. They could see that she had a rifle in her
hands, and as they watched she raised it and fired
after the retreating Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c006'>But she did not hit him, apparently—even if
such had been her intention—for he kept straight
on and vanished in an instant in the dark woods
at the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Sam Hartley, hastening
forward. “What’s the meaning of this
drama?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The words had hardly left his lips, before the
woman who had put the Chinaman to such precipitate
flight espied the approach of the newcomers.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were about to hail her when, to their
amazement, she raised her rifle to her shoulder
once more. This time it was most unmistakably
trained upon them and the good-looking face behind
the sights bore an expression that seemed to
say as plain as print:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t come any nearer if you want to avoid
trouble.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br />A NOTE OF WARNING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A comical expression came over Sam Hartley’s
face. He saw at once that the woman mistook
them for enemies—possibly allies of the Chinaman
whom, for some good reason apparently,
she had just chased off the place.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hold on there, madam,” he cried, “we’re not
here on any harm. The lads have a message
to you from your husband.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, our names are Dacre——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“For gracious sakes, why didn’t you say so in
the first place?” demanded the woman, putting
down her rifle and smiling pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you see,” spoke Sam, with a whimsical
intonation, “you didn’t give us a chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Whereat they all had to break into a laugh,
the situation seemed so ridiculous.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As I suppose you have guessed,” said the
woman, “I am Mrs. Chillingworth. That Chinaman
you just saw heading off the place I caught
hanging round the barn a few moments ago. He
was nailing a paper up there. Here it is. Look
at it and tell me what you make of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She drew from her apron pocket a bit of paper
on which the following was scrawled in a straggly
hand:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Chillingworth: You se what thee byes got.
That waz onli a sampil. A Word to the Wize is
Enuff. Live and Let Live.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sam Hartley’s face grew grave as he read,
with the boys peering over his elbow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suspected something like this,” he said, “but
I thought we would have reached here ahead of
them. I reckon that Chinaman must have known
the country hereabouts as well as I did, or better.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I allow he ought to,” said Mrs. Chillingworth.
“His name is Fu. He worked for my
husband, and you can imagine how mystified I
was when I came out a short while ago and
found him sneaking round the house like a criminal.
I asked him what he was doing and he only
answered by snarling like a nasty wild cat, and
going ahead nailing up his paper. It was then I
got the rifle and ordered him off the place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boys explained as rapidly as possible such
parts of their adventures as they thought would
not alarm Mrs. Chillingworth too much, although
it appeared to them that she was a very self-reliant
woman—the kind that a rancher in that wild
country must have found invaluable. The narration
was made in the house, into which Mrs. Chillingworth
had invited them. She set out glasses
of buttermilk, cool from the cellar, and also produced
a dish of fresh fruit, all of which was very
inviting to the dusty travelers. In the meantime,
Sam had stabled his burro in the corral, and the
long-eared little animal was already pitching into
the hay stack to the great disgust of the ranch
horses.</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as she heard the boys’ story, Mrs.
Chillingworth set about getting the various medicines
for which her husband’s note called. This
done, the boys and Sam sat down to a bountiful
meal. It was shortly before two that, mounted
on two good horses, they set out once more for
the cove. Sam Hartley and his burro went off
in another direction. The nemesis of the Chinese
smugglers said he had a clew he wished to look
up in the canyon.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was little danger of Bully Banjo or his
gang harassing the ranch before the boys returned
with the two men, so that Mrs. Chillingworth
felt no nervousness over being left alone.
The boys had at first found it hard to account for
the behavior of Fu, but Sam, after he had heard
the details of the fellow’s fright at witnessing the
burials and the awe in which he stood of the tall
Chinaman, decided that by working on his superstitious
fears the gang had pressed him into their
service. Undoubtedly he had been selected to
bear the warning paper, both because he knew
the trail and also to test him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But suppose he had weakened at the last minute
and told Mrs. Chillingworth everything?”
Tom had asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that case, Fu’s career might have reached
a sudden termination,” said Sam Hartley grimly.
“I don’t doubt that Fu was accompanied by other
members of that outfit to see that he did not play
them false.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we only saw one man,” objected Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was because the rest were hiding in that
wood yonder,” exclaimed Sam. “From what I
know of Bully Banjo he is not the man to allow
one of his untried men to go alone on an errand.
Too much depends on it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With the explicit directions they had received,
the boys arrived at the cove without missing the
trail once, or encountering any adventures. They
found the sloop anchored there still. As they rode
down the hill, they were delighted to see another
figure at Mr. Chillingworth’s side as the
ranch owner stood upright in the cockpit of the
little vessel. It was Mr. Dacre, apparently as
well almost as ever, for as he went forward to
hoist the anchor while the rancher took the sculling
oar, the boys could only detect a slight limp.</p>

<p class='c006'>It had been only a sprain after all, as they
learned presently. But, naturally, the first thing
to be done after the sloop had been sculled alongside
the rock was to explain the cause of their delay,
and the subsequent happenings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good heavens!” grated out Mr. Chillingworth,
as they related the incident of the warning
paper and Mrs. Chillingworth’s brave behavior.
“If the ranchers round here all had the
courage of that woman, Bully Banjo’s days would
soon be numbered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He was delighted, though, to hear that Sam
Hartley was on the scene. During the boys’ absence
Mr. Dacre had related to him in detail the
boys’ adventures in the Saw Mill Valley and the
part which Sam Hartley had played in them.
The rancher therefore felt that the Secret Service
man was one to be relied on.</p>

<p class='c006'>In view of Mr. Dacre’s condition, it was decided
to let him ride home on one of the horses,
accompanied by Jack, while Mr. Chillingworth
and Tom remained behind to navigate the sloop
around the point and bring her to her anchorage
in a small bay not far from the ranch house. The
sea had by this time moderated, so that they anticipated
no difficulty in doing this.</p>

<p class='c006'>As progress would be slow up the trail and Mr.
Dacre’s limb was still too painful to permit him to
ride fast, no time was wasted after this, and ten
minutes after they had received final instructions,
Mr. Dacre and his younger nephew rode off.
This time, however, the riders carried weapons.
Mr. Chillingworth would have liked to go with
them, but he was compelled to take the sloop
around to her home anchorage, not liking to leave
her alone in the cove. If the schooner, for instance,
had dropped in there, her crew were quite
capable of scuttling the little craft, just to show
that they were men to be reckoned with.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shortly after they had waved farewells to the
horsemen, who speedily vanished into the curtain
of pine woods and brush, the sloop set sail. Out
past the point she beat, with a fair wind swelling
her sails. Tom, who was quite handy about a
boat, acted as “sheet tender,” while Mr. Chillingworth
minded the helm. Before long they were
outside the cove and plunging along through the
big swells that the brisk wind had heaped up in
the open water outside.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was exhilarating sailing. The handy little
craft fairly flew along, every now and then bucking
a big sea and drenching herself with glittering
spray.</p>

<p class='c006'>But all this, pleasant as it was, held her back
a good deal, so that when darkness fell it still
found them some little distance from the anchorage
they had hoped to reach by sundown.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind,” said Mr. Chillingworth. “I
know this coast like a book. Tom, keep a good
look out forward, my boy, and when you see a
big, lone pine standing up against the sky on top
of that range of hills yonder, let me know. That
pine is a landmark for my harbor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But supper—a sandwich and a cup of coffee—grabbed
in the intervals of working the boat, was
eaten, and still no sign of the lone pine could
be made out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll beat out a bit and come in again on another
tack,” decided Mr. Chillingworth finally.
“We’re getting too close in shore for my liking.
There are a great many rocks and shoals running
out from land hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Accordingly, the sloop was put about and
headed out into the open Sound. The wind had
by this time freshened considerably. So much so,
in fact, that before long it became necessary to
take in the jib they were carrying and set a
smaller one—a storm-sail. As this was an operation
requiring some knowledge of boat handling,
the helm was given to Tom, while Mr. Chillingworth
himself went forward, dragging a big
bundle of sailcloth.</p>

<p class='c006'>As he left the cockpit, Tom noticed—or
thought he noticed—some dark object coming up
astern of them. Before long all doubt was removed.
It was a dark spire of canvas, the sails of
a vessel of some kind that he had espied. She
seemed to be coming up at a tremendous rate, too.
Even in the darkness he noted the white water as
it frothed under her forefoot. To his surprise,
the boy noticed, too, that she carried no lights.
This, however, did not bother him as the sloop’s
lights had been placed into the forestays some
time before, and shone out brightly.</p>

<p class='c006'>However, he called Mr. Chillingworth’s attention
to the approaching vessel. The rancher eyed
her keenly, pausing in his work on the wet, pitching
foredeck to do so.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Queer she carries no lights,” he commented,
“however, our port light is toward them. They
must have seen the red gleam by this time. It’s
their place to go about and get out of our way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But suppose they don’t?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, they will. They wouldn’t deliberately
run us down. Now watch your helm close, for
I’m going to lower the jib, and without any headsail
she’ll be hard to handle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom did his best to do as he was told, but just
as the jib came down a sudden puff of wind came
roaring across the water. With it came a huge
wave that curved its crest menacingly above the
tiny sloop. Tom, in his excitement, gave the
tiller a quick shove over to meet the wave quartering.
But as he altered his helm, there came
a terrific crash above his head. The sloop’s boom
swung over and she “jibed” sharply. Had the
maneuver been deliberately made in such a wind
and sea it would have been dangerous. As it
was, however, it caught them utterly unprepared.
There was a quick shout from Mr. Chillingworth,
a cry of alarm from Tom, and the lad found himself
suddenly struggling in the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sloop had capsized in an instant, and now
lay, bottom up, on the heaving sea. Mustering
all his strength, Tom struck out for her and succeeded
in reaching the hull. It was a hard task
to clamber up the slippery, wet sides, but finally
he managed it and succeeded in perching himself
on the keel.</p>

<p class='c006'>To his great delight, Mr. Chillingworth presently
joined him there. He had had a narrow escape
of being caught in the tangle of rigging,
but had kicked himself free and was unhurt. He
had no word of blame for Tom, although the lad
took himself to task bitterly for being the cause
of the accident.</p>

<p class='c006'>During these tense moments, when it was a
toss-up between life and death, they had both
forgotten the near proximity of the sailing craft
they had noticed a few minutes previously. Mr.
Chillingworth, however, placed his hands to his
mouth and hailed the craft, which was not more
than a few score of feet away from the capsized
sloop.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic004'>
<img src='images/illus169.jpg' alt='' class='ig004' />
<p>“Ahoy! Ship ahoy!” he yelled.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Ahoy! Ship ahoy!” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom joined him in his cries for help. At first
it seemed that the crew of the sailing vessel had
not noticed them, for the big craft was keeping
right on. But just when it looked as if she was
going to slip by, leaving them there on their
perilous perches, there was a sudden stir noticeable
on her decks. A light flashed near her stern,
and sharp voices were heard calling commands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently she was hove to, her sails shivering
and slapping, and her blocks rattling with an infernal
din. A voice hailed them, seemingly
through a megaphone:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ahoy thar, what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re capsized. Throw us a line!” shouted
Mr. Chillingworth.</p>

<p class='c006'>To his astonishment, instead of his appeal
being complied with, an argument seemed to ensue
on the deck of the vessel. Some man appeared,
so far as they could judge, to be urging
their rescue, while others contended against it.
“Let ’em rot there,” they heard, as one of the
voices rose louder than the others, and the wind
bore it down to them. “We ain’t in any business
where we wants strangers aboard.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the objectors, it seemed, had the worst of
the argument, for the next minute the sailing vessel
began to drift down on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get ready to catch a line,” came a shout, and
presently a rope came hissing through the air.
Mr. Chillingworth hauled on it, drawing the sloop
in under the lee of the high side of the sailing
vessel. The castaways could now see that she
was a schooner and a good-sized one, too.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hurry up, and git aboard thar,” bellowed a
rough voice, from above, as they made fast. “We
don’t want ter lose any more uv this slant uv wind
than we has to, by Chowder!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Something in the voice rang in a strangely familiar
way in Tom’s ears. Why this was so, he
was to know in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>A Jacob’s ladder was cast to them and they
clambered up it over the schooner’s rail, and presently
were standing on the stern in the lee of a
low deck-house. As they reached the deck, a figure
stepped forward from the group which had
aided in their rescue, and thrust a lantern into
their faces.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the light fell on them, this figure stepped
back with a quick exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Chillingworth, by Chowder, and”—once more
the lantern was swung forward—“one of them
young varmints thet got away this morning.
Wall, by Juniper, ef this ain’t Yankee luck.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom knew the voice well enough now. It was
Simon Lake who spoke. And it was his notorious
schooner upon whose deck they stood. Small
wonder is it that the boy’s heart beat chokingly,
and his pulses throbbed as he realized their situation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br />AT THE CHILLINGWORTH RANCH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Dacre and Jack reached the ranch without
accident or adventure. They found Mrs. Chillingworth
awaiting them with a well-spread supper
table ready, and the cheerful glow of lamps
about the house. She was disappointed that her
husband had had to go around with the sloop, but
realizing that it was an unavoidable task she
made no comment upon it. If they had fair wind
and made a good “landfall,” the rancher’s wife
said that the missing members of the party ought
to arrive about midnight. That was, unless they
elected to sleep on board the sloop.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after Mr. Dacre and his nephew had
stabled their horses and done up a few of the
rougher chores for Mrs. Chillingworth, Sam
Hartley and his burro were heard returning—that
is, the burro was, for he gave a loud “he-haw”
of anticipation as he caught a whiff of the
hay. As Mr. Dacre and Jack hastened with lanterns
to meet the returned Secret Service man,
they noticed that the burro bore a burden of some
kind across its back. As the lantern light fell on
this load, they were astonished to see that it was
the limp body of a man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll explain all about this later,” said Sam,
anticipating their questions. “The first thing is
to get this poor fellow into the house. Jack, you
take charge of the burro. This isn’t work for
boys. Now, Mr. Dacre, if you’ll lay hold of his
arms, I’ll take his legs and go easy for there
isn’t much life left in the poor chap.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was characteristic of Sam that he had betrayed
no astonishment on seeing Mr. Dacre. He
already knew that he would, in all probability, be
there that evening, and when Sam Hartley saw
that a thing had fallen out as might have been
expected, he made no comments. It was the unusual
only that aroused him.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Jack, consumed with curiosity, stabled
the burro, Mr. Dacre and Sam Hartley bore
their limp burden into the house. Mrs. Chillingworth
at once made ready a spare room for him,
while Mr. Dacre and Sam laid him on the lounge
and set about doing what they could to revive
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first thing Mr. Dacre noticed was that
there were red bands round the man’s wrists
where the flesh had been cut deeply into. For the
rest, his limited medical experience showed him
that the man was suffering from exhaustion and
possibly fright. What had caused the abrasions
on his wrists, however, Mr. Dacre could not imagine.</p>

<p class='c006'>The man was dressed roughly, in a faded
shirt, very dirty and stained corduroy trousers,
and cow-hide boots. He had no hat and his lank
hair hung dankly about his bloated, red face. His
nose was huge and bulbous, and his whole appearance
was that of a man of dissipated habits.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently—while they were still trying to revive
the fellow—Jack came in from the barn. As
soon as his eyes fell upon the man on the lounge,
he gave a cry of surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why that’s one of the fellows who was set
to guard us!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sam Hartley looked up quickly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is, eh? One of the chaps who went to sleep
and gave you a chance to use that knife?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes. What is he doing here? Where did
you find him? What is the matter with him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Jack fairly poured out the questions. Sam
Hartley smiled at his impatience.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One at a time, lad,” he said, with a deliberation
that was positively irritating to Jack, who
was wild with curiosity. “Now here’s Mrs.
Chillingworth, and I guess she’s come to tell us
that the bed is ready. We’ll get this fellow into
it, and then when we’ve all had some supper I’ll
tell you just how I came to find him. I reckon
he’s one of Bully Banjo’s horrible examples.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Horrible examples?” echoed Jack. “How do
you mean?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I mean,” said Sam Hartley slowly, as he
helped Mr. Dacre lift the still senseless man,
“that he’s been paying pretty dearly for his
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Led by Mrs. Chillingworth, holding the lamp
high above her head, they bore him to a small
room upstairs. But it was some time before they
could do more than watch him anxiously and
await the time for him to speak.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meantime, after supper, as he had
promised, Sam Hartley told how he came to run
across the unfortunate fellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As you know,” he began, after he had lighted
his pipe, and they all sat about in interested attitudes
in the big, comfortable living room; “as
you know, when I left here this afternoon, it was
for a definite purpose—to discover if possible how
Bully Banjo and his men managed to get inland
from the sea without crossing any trails. Well,
I found out that at the same time as I found this
fellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was this way: I had an idea in my mind
as to how those rascals were getting into the
canyon. Well, I found out that soon enough. As
I expected, they were using a tunnel made by the
river under the range, between the canyon and
the sea. It was the simplest thing in the world
for them to land their Mongolians right on the
beach and then march ’em through that hole. In
some places I guess they must have had to wade
up to their knees, though.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, then you didn’t go through it?” inquired
Jack.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No indeed,” was the rejoinder. “I wasn’t going
to take a chance like that. I just got close
enough to see the big opening—mostly screened
by brush it was—the tracks in the sand along
the side of the river told me the rest. But all
that isn’t telling you about that poor fellow upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sam Hartley paused here, looked very grave,
and shoved the tobacco down in his pipe bowl.
Then he resumed:</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ve all read of pirates and stringing up by
the thumbs, and things like that, but I never
thought I’d live to see the victim of such practices.
But that—or something very like it—is
what had been done to our red-faced friend. As
I emerged from the vicinity of the tunnel I heard
a groan a little way up the canyon. I followed
the sound up and soon came to where they had
strung that chap up in a tree by his wrists. There
he was, dangling about in the hot sun, suspended
by his two wrists and nothing else. His feet
were a foot or more off the ground.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His hearers uttered horrified exclamations.
Then Jack asked:</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how did they come to tie him there, and
why?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, the ‘why’ part of that is soon answered,”
said the Secret Service man. “It was as
a punishment for letting you escape. As to why
they chose just that place, I imagine it was because
they had trailed you boys down the river
bank. When they reached the tunnel and found
no trace of you, they knew you must have got
clear away, and so they proceeded to string up
that chap as a horrible example.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what about the Indian? He was equally
guilty. Why didn’t they punish him, too?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, that I cannot answer. I guess, though,
the Indian probably cleared out during the excitement
following your escape. His race are
pretty wise, as a rule, and he surmised there
would be trouble in store for him if he stayed.
I’m mighty glad I found that fellow, though, for
other reasons than those of humanity.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What—for instance?” asked Mr. Dacre.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I think we may be able to get a lot of
useful information out of him about the gang.
Information that will help me to get them just
where I want them. For, you see, when I do get
ready to start in on them, I don’t want to run
any chances of a slip up. I want to be able to
bring my hand down on the whole shooting match
and stamp them out for all time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When they retired that night the red-nosed
man had so far recovered as to be able to give an
account of himself. As Sam had guessed, it was
Bully Banjo who had triced the unfortunate fellow
up as a “lesson” for his carelessness. The
man also confirmed Sam’s guess that the Indian
had saved himself by running away. But he had
not escaped scot-free, for before the Chinook
managed to make his escape Simon Lake had ordered
him tied up and several lashes administered.
These had been laid on by Zeb Hunt, with
a promise of more to come, but when the gang
returned from the fruitless search after the boys
it was found that the Indian had, in some manner
best known to himself, slipped his bonds and made
his way to freedom.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the red-nosed man it was also learned
that Bully Banjo intended to run the Chinamen
through that day, and set sail the same night for
the island where, as the rancher had suspected
right along, deliveries of Chinamen were made.
In answer to Jack’s questions it was explained
that the Chinese were brought across the Pacific
as far as Vancouver Island in an ostensible
freight steamer. From this they were transferred
at a lonely spot to another vessel, which
brought them to the island. Here they were
kept till opportunities presented themselves to get
them through into the States.</p>

<p class='c006'>No real apprehension was felt at the ranch
concerning the rancher and Tom Dacre till about
noon the next day, when they failed to put in an
appearance. Even allowing for headwinds and
other possible delays, this began to look serious.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was about mid-afternoon that a man on
horseback reached the ranch. He was a neighboring
landholder, whose ranch bordered in some
places on the coast of the Sound. His face was
grave as he slipped from his horse in front of
the ranch house, and he saw Sam Hartley and
Mr. Dacre coming toward him with a good deal
of relief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m glad I didn’t have to face the woman with
the news I’ve got,” he said. “That there sloop
of Chillingworth’s drifted ashore bottom up in
my cove this morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From behind the little group there came a
piercing scream, and Sam Hartley turned just in
time to catch Mrs. Chillingworth as she swooned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And there was no trace of her occupants?”
asked Mr. Dacre, in a voice he strove to make
steady in spite of the trembling of his lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We had a tough blow last night,” he said,
“and I guess that sloop went over before they
could do a thing. My advice is to watch the
beaches. Their bodies are likely to drift ashore
sooner or later.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c007'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br />“STEAMER, AHOY!”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Tom, all I can say is—we must keep
on hoping for the best.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Mr. Chillingworth who spoke, the morning
after the casting away of the sloop.</p>

<p class='c006'>He and Tom Dacre were standing against the
lee rail of the schooner amidships, watching with
gloomy faces the white spume as it sped by.
Above them the canvas was bellied out, heeling
the schooner smartly and putting her on her sailing
lines. On the other hand, could be dimly
seen the blue shores of the Strait of San Juan de
Fuca. Bully Banjo’s schooner was making for
the open Pacific, but what was her destination
they had not the slightest idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>The events of the night before seemed like a
nightmare viewed in the crisp, sparkling, early
daylight, with the white deck of a fast schooner
under their feet. Somewhat to their surprise,
Simon Lake had offered them no violence, and
had even accommodated them with a berth in the
cabin, turning out one of his own men for the
purpose. If Mr. Chillingworth was as good a
judge of human emotions as he deemed himself
to be, it appeared to him that the Chinese runner
was glad rather than otherwise at the way things
had fallen out, and, so far at least, not disposed to
offer them any active harm. At breakfast, which
was just over, Simon Lake, who, with Zeb Hunt,
had shared the meal with the castaways, had
seemed particularly inclined to be amiable. One
thing, though, was noticeable: he did not refer
in any way to the occurrences of the night before,
nor to the events which had preceded them.
For all that appeared to the contrary, any listener
to the conversation might have imagined
that Tom Dacre and the rancher were honored
guests of the sea ranger.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, of course, all this show of friendliness
had not for an instant deceived either of the castaways.
Tom’s experience in Simon Lake’s camp
had taught him just what the man was, and what
he would dare to do. As for Mr. Chillingworth,
he had long ago made up his mind that their
present host was the most dangerous man on the
Pacific Slope. Doubtless he was even now discussing
a course of action with Zeb Hunt, down
in the cabin, where both had been closeted since
breakfast. Taking advantage of this, Tom and
Mr. Chillingworth had slipped on deck to try to
get an opportunity to talk the situation over.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, not so very greatly to their surprise, this
proved to be a hard thing to do. As soon as they
stopped at any one spot and began to talk, some
member of the crew—many of whom Tom recognized
as having occupied the camp in the canyon—happened
along on some errand or other, apparently
accidental. Of course, there was little
doubt that they had been told to overhear all they
could and report it to their leader.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you any idea where we are bound?” inquired
Tom, not caring much whether a man who
had just come up ostensibly to coil a rope heard
him or not.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not the slightest,” rejoined Mr. Chillingworth,
“unless it can be to that island of Simon
Lake’s—or rather of the syndicate engaged in
this rascally business.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom’s face fell.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Once they get us there,” he said disconsolately,
“we won’t stand much chance of getting
away again till they wish it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is so,” agreed Mr. Chillingworth, in an
equally gloomy tone; “yet what are we to do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He sank his voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have thought over a dozen plans of escape,
but none of them will bear analysis. It looks as
if we are absolutely in this rascal’s power.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why not hail a passing vessel—provided one
comes near enough?” suggested Tom. “Surely
our signals would attract attention.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we could make them—yes,” rejoined Mr.
Chillingworth, “but you don’t suppose, do you,
that they would give us such an opportunity?
Why the minute one of us sprang on that rail to
wave for help we would be knocked down and
perhaps badly injured.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just the same I’m going to make a try for it,”
thought Tom to himself, “if any opportunity offers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Simon Lake himself, and his scrubby-haired
first mate, had now emerged from the cabin companionway,
and were pacing the inclined stern
deck. Every now and again, Lake crossed to the
side of the man at the wheel and peered into the
compass. From time to time he cast an eye aloft
at the canvas. The schooner was carrying every
bit of plainsail, despite the smart wind that was
humming through her rigging. Evidently, Lake
did not believe in allowing his ship to loaf along.
He carried an amount of canvas which would
have given an old-fashioned skipper heart disease.
The schooner showed the strain, too.
Every now and again, she would give a heel that
sent her lee rail under and the yeasty foam boiling
and swirling along the scuppers.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last, shortly before noon, the opportunity
for which Tom had been waiting presented itself.
Dead ahead, across the tumbling blue water,
could be seen the heeling, rolling form of a
steamer. She was coming toward them and if
she held her present course, would be bound to
pass them a short distance to lee. When she did
so, Tom made up his mind that he was going to
try to attract her attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>On came the vessel, black smoke pouring from
her funnel and her masts cutting crazy arcs
against the sky. Now and then the sun flashed
on her wet plates as she rolled. She was a black
craft with towering white upper decks, which
showed her to be a passenger craft. On board
her was safety, law, and order. Tom’s heart
fairly ached to attract her attention. The case
was no different with the rancher, but what with
anxiety over the worry his wife would be feeling,
and general trouble over their position, Mr.
Chillingworth had had little to say for the last
hour or two. He had sat silently at the foot of
the foremast, his head in his hands and lost in the
dismal trend of his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c006'>The steamer was now almost abeam of them.
So close was she that Tom could catch the glint
of brass buttons on her bridge and the gay colors
of the ladies’ dresses as they walked along the
promenade decks, and no doubt remarked to their
escorts on the beauty of the little schooner heading
out to the open sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the two ships drew abeam, Tom leaped into
the lee rigging, hanging on by one of the fore
shrouds. His cap—an old sea affair, given him
by Bully Banjo—was in his hand, and he was
raising his arm to wave it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ahoy! Steamer, ahoy!” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wind bore his cries down toward the other
vessel and a commotion could be seen on her
bridge. Presently there came a gush of white
steam from her whistle and her way decreased
noticeably. But Tom had hardly had time to take
in these details before a heavy hand fell on his
shoulder and the next instant Zeb Hunt’s rough
fist had felled him to the deck.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You young shark!” snarled the mate, “this is
the worst day’s work you’ve ever done. You
keep off there, Chillingworth,” he went on truculently,
as the rancher came forward protesting.
“This is our affair.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The rancher glanced helplessly about him.
The entire crew had gathered about the prostrate
boy. It would have been worse than madness to
have resisted any of Hunt’s mandates just then.
Suddenly a voice hailed from the stern.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good work thar, Mister Hunt. Jes’ keep
that young catamount down thar while I untangle
this yar mess.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Simon Lake. As he spoke, he took a
megaphone from its rack just inside the companionway.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Schooner, ahoy! What’s the trouble on board
you?” came a hail from the steamer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ain’t nawthin’ wrong here as I’m awares on,”
hailed back Simon, his downeast drawl more pronounced
than ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing wrong, you deep sea vagabond, then
what in the name of Neptune do you mean by
stopping us this way? Don’t you know we carry
the mails?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sorry,” shouted Simon apologetically, “but,
yer see, we’ve got a kind uv a poor looney bye
aboard. He thought, poor critter, it ’ud be er
joke ter hail yer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, he did, did he?” shouted back the commander
of the steamer. “Well, you’d better keep
your looney under lock and key when mail boats
are passing. Come ahead there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Deep down in the engine room of the steamer
the bells jangled and she raced off once more,
bound Seattleward. But as it so happened the
vessel, which was the “Islander” of the Seattle-Hawaii
Line, had a record for punctuality, and
her slight delay following Tom’s hail was used by
the captain as an excuse for some hours he had
lost at sea in bad weather. It, therefore, received
more space in the Seattle papers than it
would have done otherwise. In fact, quite an
item appeared about the “crazy boy” on board
the outward-bound schooner, who had delayed
the “Islander” by his antics. In course of events
the paper with this news in it reached Sam Hartley.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was two days after the “Islander” had
docked. But, nothing daunted, Sam set out for
Seattle that same night with the bottle-nosed man
as a companion.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was anxious to find the captain of the
“Islander,” and get from him a description of
that schooner. If she was the Chinese runner’s
vessel, the bottle-nosed man would recognize her
from the steamer skipper’s description. At least,
Sam hoped so.</p>

<p class='c006'>At any rate, it looked like the only likely clew
to the fate of Mr. Chillingworth and Tom, and
was, therefore, worth looking into, for after an
examination of the sloop Sam had soon come to
the conclusion that there were unusual circumstances
connected with her abandonment.</p>

<p class='c006'>For one thing, he had found that the rope attached
to her bow had been cut—and with a keen
knife, too. This was the rope, it will be recalled,
that was thrown to the capsized mariners from
the deck of the schooner, and had been cut when
the sloop was set adrift.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in the meantime Mr. Chillingworth and
Tom were encountering a series of adventures
stranger than any that had yet befallen the Bungalow
Boy, and we must leave Sam and follow
their fortunes in the hands of Bully Banjo and
his men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br />AN ATTEMPT AT FOUL PLAY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As might have been expected, Tom’s outburst
was followed by confinement to the cabin. But
this he did not mind so much, as Mr. Chillingworth
was his companion, and they found more
opportunities to talk over their position thus than
was the case on deck, where they were constantly
under observation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cabin of the schooner was plainly furnished.
In the center was a swinging table, oilcloth
covered, with four plain swivel chairs at
each side, and one at each end. On the floor was
some gaudy matting. Above the board hung a
big brass lamp. It depended from the crossbars
under a skylight opening on deck. At the farther
end of the cabin was a flight of ladder-like stairs,
leading to the deck. On each side were doors,
opening on small staterooms. The wood was
pine—of no very good quality—and varnished.
At the forward end was a bulkhead of the same
material, along which ran a lounge covered with
leather, or an imitation of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had been almost two days at sea now, and
still no intimation had come from Simon Lake
as to what his intentions were in regard to them.
But even Tom’s attempt to signal the schooner
was not punished with any violence, except Zeb
Hunt’s knock-down blow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Reckin you’ll be safer in the cabin arter this,
by Juniper,” Simon Lake had said, helping the
recumbent boy to his feet, and that had been all,
except that Tom had deemed it prudent to carry
out the hint conveyed in Lake’s words to the letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be wearisome and useless to detail
the conversations between Mr. Chillingworth and
his young companion. They were all on one subject,
and that was: how were they to escape from
their predicament. But they all ended in the
same place. That is to say—nowhere. Night
and day the schooner swarmed with men, so to
try to cut away one of the boats, as Tom had
suggested, was soon declared to be manifestly impossible.</p>

<p class='c006'>At meals Simon Lake and Zeb Hunt shared
the table with them, but at other times they had
the cabin to themselves, except for the occasional
ghost-like goings and comings of the tall Chinaman.
In this connection it may be interesting to
note that since coming on board Tom had seen
the recreant Fu. The former employee of Mr.
Chillingworth was working on a sail with the
crew when his eyes met Tom’s. But whatever
he may have felt, no expression appeared on the
yellow mask that did duty for his face. Tom surmised
that, in exchange for a promise of loyalty
to the gang, he had been made one of them. But
of the status of the tall Chinaman, who seemed
to be a man of some influence with both crew and
officers, it was more difficult to guess. Mr. Chillingworth
was inclined to think he was some sort
of a priest. He based this theory on the veneration
which Fu had shown on the night he had
seen his big countryman at the burial of the dead
in the cove. For the rest, the tall Mongolian ate
by himself and had his own cabin. Not by word
or sign, since they had been on board, had he conveyed
a hint that he had ever seen Tom before,
although he must have recognized the boy he had
conducted to Simon Lake at the camp in the
canyon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hitherto the schooner had had fair weather,
although the wind had been strong. But this
afternoon the sky began to grow overcast and
there was an ominous feeling in the air that betokened
the coming of a storm. By supper time,
in fact, the schooner was laboring along in a
heavy sea and under much reduced canvas. But
even the reefing which had been done was against
Lake’s will. In her cabin they could hear his
voice coming down through the skylight in angry
argument with Zeb Hunt.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By Chowder, it’s my way to clap on all she’ll
carry.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you’ll have the sticks out of her by sundown,”
Zeb had protested.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right, then, shorten up if you want to.
But not more than one reef in the main sail, mind
yer. I’m a downeast sailorman, and we don’t
b’lieve in sailing ships ter suit young ladies’ seminaries.”</p>

<p class='c006'>By sundown the wind had developed into a
screeching gale. Every timber and bolt in the
schooner cried out and complained with a different
voice. Under the heavy sail that Simon
Lake obstinately insisted on carrying, she was
being heavily racked.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the way in which things in the cabin
were tumbled about, the gale must have been
terrific, but when Mr. Chillingworth tried to go
on deck to see what sort of a night it was, he
was met by a stern order from Simon Lake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go back thar in ther cabin, Chillingworth,”
he ordered. “The deck ain’t no place fer you ternight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after, he came down and entered his
cabin. He emerged in oilskins. Zeb Hunt followed
his example. What, with the trampling of
feet as the crew ran about the decks, the increasing
motion of the ship, and the cruel uproar the
creaking timbers kept up, there was no sleep for
the castaways, and till long after the usual hour
for going to their cabin they sat up. A certain
amount of apprehension mingled with their
other feelings. It is one thing to be upon deck,
active and alert, in a big storm, and quite another
pair of shoes to be confined in a
stuffy cabin, not knowing what is happening
above and whether at any moment you may not
see green water come tumbling down the companionway.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shortly before midnight the rancher and Tom
Dacre turned in. But it was not to sleep. The
storm was decidedly increasing in fury every
minute. The little vessel seemed fairly to stand
on its head one instant and the next to be rearing
upward, pointing toward the stars.</p>

<p class='c006'>What time it was Tom had no idea, but he figured
afterward that it must have been about
two hours after they turned in when he was
awakened from a troubled doze by loud voices in
the cabin outside, and a trampling of feet, as if
several persons were there. Opening the door a
crack, he peered out.</p>

<p class='c006'>He saw Simon Lake, very pale, and bleeding
from a big cut in his head, laid out on the forward
lounge, while Zeb Hunt and several of the
others bent over him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It all comes of crackin’ on so,” Hunt was saying.
“If we hadn’t carried all that canvas, we
wouldn’t never have had that sail rip loose, and
then Bully here wouldn’t have got hit with that
block.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it a bad cut, Zeb?” asked one of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, it’s purty deep,” said Zeb, who by this
time had opened a locker and was selecting some
bandages from it. “But I reckon we kin fix
it. How d’yer feel now, Bully?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The injured man gave a groan. It was evident
that he was partially stunned by what Tom
guessed, from what he had overheard, was a
falling block. Soon after he was carried into his
cabin, the tall Chinaman being left to watch him.</p>

<p class='c006'>After that the hours wore on somehow. From
time to time Tom fell into an uneasy nap
to awaken with a start of alarm and a horrible
fear that the schooner was at last going to the
bottom.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a clock in the cabin, affixed to the
forward bulkhead, and after one of these sudden
awakenings he decided to peep out and see what
time it was. He longed for the coming of day
with every nerve within him. If the schooner
was to sink, he felt that it would be better in the
daylight than in the pitchy darkness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Steadying himself by the side of the bunk in
which Mr. Chillingworth lay sleeping as peacefully
as if he were at home, Tom peered out.
He caught his breath with a start as he did so,
and saw the figure of the tall Chinaman standing
upright above the table in the center of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c006'>In front of him was a glass of water. He had
evidently just fetched it from the small keg at
the after-end of the cabin for the injured man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom could hear Simon Lake’s voice from another
stateroom:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cheng! Cheng! Hurry with thet thar
water, you blamed yellow-faced Chink.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yellow-faced Chink, am I?” Tom heard the
Chinaman mutter, as he reached into his loose
blouse and pulled out a small vial containing a
red fluid. “Well, Bully Banjo, I am about to
demonstrate to you that we yellow-faced Chinks
are more than a match for men of your caliber.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As the Chinaman muttered the words, he allowed
a few drops of the red liquid to fall into
the glass of water.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One swallow of this and you enter the white
devil’s heaven,” he snarled, tiptoeing toward the
cabin in which lay the injured leader of the Chinese
runners.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s poison,” gasped Tom to himself, “and
he’s going to give it to Simon Lake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Already the tall Chinaman’s hand was on the
handle of the stateroom door, and he was about to
enter it when Tom’s door opened, and above the
uproar of the storm he shouted:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hold on a minute there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinaman faced around like a flash. There
was an evil expression on his face, but it changed
to a smile as he saw the boy. For a forced smile
summoned so hastily to the surface it was a very
creditable one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, it is the white boy,” he exclaimed. “What
do you want, white boy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’d like a drink of water,” said Tom. “Let’s
have that glass a minute, will you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinaman looked hard at him for an instant
as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.
Then, satisfied apparently that Tom had seen
nothing, he said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bym bye you can have. Jes’ now me go give
dlink to Missa Lake.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Still grinning like a yellow image, he glided
into the cabin occupied by the injured man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here, give it to me, quick. Consarn it, the
thirst is burning me up,” Simon Lake cried, as
he reached for the glass.</p>

<p class='c006'>But before his fingers could close on it, it was
dashed from his grasp and its contents spilled
over the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Consarn your mischievous hide, what d’ye
mean by that?” bellowed Lake, furiously turning
on Tom, who had entered the cabin in two flying
leaps, just in time to save the rascal from drinking
the stuff.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t owe you any debt of gratitude,” rejoined
Tom, “but I don’t want to see you poisoned
by a scoundrelly Chinaman. That fellow
drugged that water.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wh-a-a-a-a-a-t!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right. If you don’t believe it, have
him searched. You’ll find a small vial of red
stuff in his blouse. He dropped some of it into
your water, and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Stunned by the suddenness with which his rascally
plot had been discovered, the Chinaman had
hitherto remained motionless. Now, with a bellow
of rage, he leaped at Tom, flinging his long,
wiry arms about him.</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy struggled bravely, but the yellow man
had the first hold and he was tremendously
strong, as Tom soon found out while he helplessly
thrashed and struggled.</p>

<p class='c006'>But either Simon Lake was not as badly injured
as they thought, or else he managed to
make a superhuman effort, for just as the Mongolian
had Tom down on the cabin floor and his
yellow fingers were digging in his throat, Lake
hurled himself out of his bunk upon the yellow
man, bearing him with resistless force to the floor
under his great weight.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the tableau that Zeb Hunt, rushing
into the cabin, arrived just in time to see. He
came to the aid of his superior and they soon had
the tall Chinaman helpless.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sarch his blouse, Zeb! Sarch his blouse!”
bellowed Simon Lake, his wound apparently forgotten
in his excitement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll tie him first,” said the prudent Zeb, producing
some yarn. Then, with the Mongolian
helplessly pinioned to a stanchion, the mate proceeded
to search him. Almost the first object he
found was the vial which Tom had seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here it is, boss,” he said. “Just as the youngster
said.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinaman bent an angry glare on them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Him no poison. Him medicine,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it is, is it. Well, I’ll mix you up a dose
of it and see if you’ll take it,” declared Zeb.</p>

<p class='c006'>Procuring a glass, he mixed up some of the red
drops with water. But when they were thrust
toward him, the Chinaman had to admit by his
refusal to take it that the stuff was deadly poison.</p>

<p class='c006'>Simon Lake, white and shaky, now that the excitement
was over, had sunk back on the lounge.
He kept passing his hand over his bandaged brow
as he looked on as if to try to assure himself that
he was awake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just ter think that thet thar rascal Cheng
who I’ve trusted like a babby would hev tried to
give me a deal like thet,” he kept repeating.
“What d’yer think got inter the feller, Zeb?
Why did he want ter do it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In ther fust place, because he’s jes’ naturally
mean and pesky, bein’ a Chink,” rejoined Zeb,
“and in ther next, I reckon he figured that with
you out of the way and the rest of us busy on
deck, he’d rob you uv that money belt of yours
and nobody be the wiser.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Maybe you’re right,” rejoined the injured
man grimly, “but I’m too sick ter attend ter him
now. But, by Juniper, wait till I’m well. I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c006'>There came a sudden jarring crash. The
schooner trembled as though she had been dealt
a mortal blow. At the same time there was a
terrible grinding of timbers, and a confused uproar
of alarmed shouts and cries from above.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jee-hos-o-phat, we’ve struck!” shouted Zeb,
bolting from the cabin. He darted up the stairs
in an instant. Simon Lake, staggering as he
went, followed him. An instant later Mr. Chillingworth,
aroused by the clamor and the shock,
appeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on,” cried Tom, “something’s happened.
I don’t know what, but maybe our opportunity to
escape has arrived.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br />A STRANGE ENCOUNTER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On deck they found a scene of the wildest confusion.
The wind had abated somewhat, but
there was still a big sea running. To the east the
sky was gray and wan with the first streaks of
dawn, and the waste of tumbling waters was
lighted dimly by the newborn light. Forward
was a crowd of men, in the midst of them being
Zeb Hunt. The wounded Bully Banjo had managed
to claw his way forward along the swaying
decks also, and stood by his mate’s side, holding
on to a back stay.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Chillingworth and Tom Dacre hastened
forward to see what had happened. They found
the group of seamen clustered about some figures
that they had just hauled over the side with life
belts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Their boat went down like a rock when we
struck her,” one of the crew, who had been on
deck when the collision occurred, was explaining
to another, as the boy hastened past.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the next instant he stopped short with a
gasp of astonishment. In the center of the group
of sailors and rescued persons from the small
craft the schooner had seemingly just run down,
was one that was strangely familiar. As Tom
drew nearer he heard a youthful voice pipe up.
Its owner’s small form was hidden by the clustering
seamen of the schooner:</p>

<p class='c006'>“What kind of a boat is this, pa-pa?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is a schooner, my child. It has just run
us down,” rejoined the tall, lanky figure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What did they run us down for, pa-pa?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Professor Dingle!” cried Tom, recognizing
first the questioning voice of the professor’s son
and heir, and then the tall, bony figure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tom Dacre, my boy!” cried the professor delightedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How came you here?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I might ask the same question of you,” rejoined
the professor. “I was cruising north toward
the Aleutian peninsula in my little yawl-rigged
boat, when out of the darkness this
schooner came upon me and ran me down. My
two faithful Kanakas and my boy and myself
only managed to save ourselves by a hair’s
breadth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how did you come to be hereabouts, professor?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Again the same question might apply to you,
my lad, but the fact is that I’m off on a scientific
cruise to the Aleutian Islands in search of rare
specimens. We sailed from Victoria three days
ago and ran into that terrible storm last night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The crew stood about grinning while the professor
was making his explanations. They
seemed to think the whole thing a rare joke, now
that the shock of the collision was over and it had
been ascertained that no damage had been sustained
by the schooner. As for the professor
himself, he accepted the situation as calmly as if
it were an everyday matter. His two Kanakas,
brown-skinned, black-haired fellows of slender,
yet athletic build—of whom more hereafter—also
accepted the situation, seemingly as an unavoidable
stroke of fate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom introduced the professor to Mr. Chillingworth.
Surely never were introductions gone
through amid stranger surroundings! Hardly
had the ceremony been concluded than word came
forward by one of the crew that Simon Lake
wished them all to report aft in the cabin at
once.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was not a summons to be disregarded,
and, headed by Tom and the professor, whose inquisitive
offspring clutched tightly to his hand,
they started along the plunging, rolling decks.
On their way aft Tom explained the exact situation
to the professor—or as much of it as he
could in the few seconds of time he had. The
man of science took it with as unmoved an air as
he accepted most happenings in his life.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was vexed, though, at the interruption of
his scientific expedition, which he had undertaken
in the interests of the Puget Sound University,
whose intention it was to form a museum of Pacific
Coast flora and fauna, second to none.</p>

<p class='c006'>“However,” he remarked, with a philosophical
shrug, “it is no use railing at fate. The only
thing to be done is to make the best of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Which, incidentally, was as good a bit of philosophy
as the professor could have found in any
of his books.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And now,” he concluded briskly, “let us see
what sort of a man is in command of this ship.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The first object that met their eyes as they
made their way down the steep companion stairs
was not one calculated to inspire a timid man with
confidence.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tall Chinaman, his face contorted from the
pain of his tight thongs, was still secured to the
stanchion. His face worked as he saw the newcomers,
and for an instant Tom thought he was
going to make an appeal for mercy. But if such
had been his intention, he thought better of it and
remained silent. It was Simon Lake who broke
the silence that reigned as the “passengers,” as
they may be called, ranged themselves along the
cabin bulkhead, awaiting Simon Lake’s announcement
of the cause of his summons. It was not
long in coming. Lake, who was sprawled out on
the lounge with Zeb Hunt at his side, eyed them
a minute as if in some doubt how to begin. His
hawk-like face was not improved by the bandage
which now enwrapped his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What makes that man look so funny, pa-pa?”
whispered the professor’s offspring inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush,” cautioned the professor; “he’s going
to speak.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, gents,” began Simon Lake harshly,
“we’ve got considerable more of a crew on board
this craft than we started out with. Ther only
question in my mind is wot ter do with yer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Certainly Simon Lake had a way of coming
to the point without beating about the bush,
which might be imitated by some of our legal
lights and other public luminaries.</p>

<p class='c006'>As no one answered, and he did not seem to
expect them to, he resumed:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, I might chuck the whole shootin’
match of yer overboard. But I ain’t goin’ ter do
it. You, Chillingworth, I don’t see as you’re entitled
ter any mercy. You’d hev made it hard fer
me ef yer could. You’d hev seen me ahind bars
ef you’d hed yer way—wouldn’t yer now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, since you put it so directly, Simon Lake,
I certainly would have done my best to secure
your being put out of business, so far as your
nefarious trade is concerned.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ah, but yer didn’t,” grinned Simon Lake maliciously,
“and now I’ve got yer right whar I
want yer—an’ I’m goin’ ter keep yer, too. Lucky
I nailed yer afore you could carry out yer little
idee of settin’ ther Secret Service onter me—eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He knows nothing about Sam Hartley, then,”
thought Tom, with a flash of distinct relief.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Mr. Chillingworth made no answer except
to look the rascal straighter in the eye, Lake resumed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, luck, er fate, er providence, er whatever
yer like ter call it, hez certainly turned ther
tables on yer in a most re-markable way,” he went
on, in a musing tone. “An’ I ain’t one ter fly
no ways in ther face uv providence. Here you
are, and here you’ll stay. I’ve got work fer you
an’ ther rest, too, whar we air a-goin’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And where is that, may I ask?” inquired Mr.
Chillingworth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake grinned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, to er delightful island thet we ought ter
be raisin’ at any moment now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But if they hoped to hear any more about their
destination just then, they were disappointed, for
Lake went on without any further reference to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This gent here is a perfesser, I understan’,”
he said. “Waal, maybe I’ll hev a job fer him,
too. Do you understand assaying, perfesser?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The science of gauging the value of the metals
contained in any ore-bearing rock, do you mean?”
asked the scientist.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, that’s a heap o’ fancy sail ter carry
onter it, but ter come down ter brass tacks, by
Chowder, that’s jes’ the idee I want ter convey.
Do you understand it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, to some extent—yes. Have you any ore
you wish assayed?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll tell yer abaout thet later,” said Lake, with
a cunning leer. “Now, then,” he resumed, “what
is them two black fellers you’ve got thar—Kanakas,
ain’t they?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The professor nodded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope you mean them no harm,” he said.
“They are faithful, hard-working fellows, and excellent
sailors. Their names are Monday and
Tuesday, so called after the days on which they
were hired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Das so. Yes, boss, das so, fer a fac’,” said
one of the South Sea natives, pulling his black
silky forelock in true sailor fashion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I reckon we kin fin’ work fer them, too,” decided
Lake. “Yer see, it’s jes’ this way: Whar
we’re goin’ every one hez ter work, er else starve.
I reckon you’d rather work then starve, so I’m
goin’ ter give yer all a chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“One question, Lake,” put in the rancher.
“I’ve a home and wife back yonder on the Sound.
In mercy’s name, tell me, and tell me the truth—am
I ever going to see them again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake looked at him curiously, and then the
wretch deliberately rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Reckon the weather’s clearin’ quite a bit, Zeb,”
he said, without taking the slightest notice of
the perturbed rancher. “We’d best be gittin’ on
deck. By the bye,” he said suddenly turning to
Tom, “you did me a sarvice with that thar yaller
devil. I’ll not forget it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He started for the companionway stairs followed
by Zeb. It was his evident intention to pay
no heed to Mr. Chillingworth. But the rancher
intercepted him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“As you are human, Lake,” he pleaded, “answer
my question. Think, man, what it means to
me—to my wife——”</p>

<p class='c006'>He stopped short, evidently afraid to trust his
voice further. Lake turned and met his outburst
with a cruel smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’re reckonin’ on hevin’ yer with us fer
quite a stay, Chillingworth,” he said, setting his
foot on the bottom step of the companionway, “so
make up yer mind ter thet. We need yer ranch,
and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before he could add another word Chillingworth’s
form was hurtling across the cabin. The
rancher, distracted for the moment by his wrongs,
flew at the bully like a wild beast. Lake staggered
and almost fell under the unexpected onslaught,
but the next instant he recovered himself
and drew and leveled a pistol. That moment
might have been the rancher’s last, but for Zeb
Hunt. At the same instant as Lake drew his revolver,
the mate of the schooner raised his heavy-booted
foot and dealt Mr. Chillingworth a brutal
kick in the pit of the stomach. As the pistol exploded
the rancher sank down in a heap, groaning
in agony. The bullet flew by Tom’s ear and
buried itself in a panel of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thet’s what any uv ther rest uv yer’ll git ef
yer try ter cut up monkey shines, by Heck!”
snarled Lake, blowing the smoke from the barrel
of his revolver with the utmost calmness.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Tom sprang forward to aid the suffering
rancher, Lake and Zeb Hunt proceeded to the
deck. Under the lad’s ministrations Mr. Chillingworth
presently grew somewhat better, and Tom
and the professor managed to help him into his
cabin, where they laid him out on a bunk.</p>

<p class='c006'>While they were all in the small stateroom,
even the two Kanakas, who seemed to dislike the
idea of being left alone, being with them, there
came a sudden click of the lock of the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom, guessing what had happened, but still
not permitting himself to believe it, sprang to
the portal. He shook it furiously, but it resisted
his efforts to open it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Prisoners!” he gasped. “They’ve locked the
door!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Realizing that it was no use attempting to force
the portal open, they decided to await Lake’s
pleasure in the matter of opening it. In the
meantime, they turned once more to the subject
of a possible chance for escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One thing is certain,” the professor decided,
at the end of the discussion of a dozen or more
plans, “we are in no immediate danger. It is
equally certain that we can do nothing while we
are on board the schooner. The only thing to do
is to wait till we reach this island. When we
know just what is going to happen to us we can
formulate plans better, in the meantime we——”</p>

<p class='c006'>He stopped short. There was a trampling of
feet in the cabin outside. It sounded as if a
struggle were in progress. For an instant a voice
broke out in wild pleadings—or so it seemed—but
the cries were suddenly hushed as if a hand had
been placed over the mouth of whoever was uttering
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the trampling ceased and the sound of
footsteps ascending the companion stairway
could be heard. All this the prisoners in the
cabin had heard in silence. As the sounds died
away Tom turned to the others.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It must have been that Chinaman! They——”</p>

<p class='c006'>A sudden piercing scream assailed their ears.
Their cheeks whitened as they heard it, so wild
and ringing and appealing was the cry.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was succeeded by deadly silence. What could
have occurred? They all had a guess in their
minds, but none of them dared to voice it. One
thing, though, Tom was certain of, and that was
that the cry had come from the deck. In that
case——</p>

<p class='c006'>But at this point of his meditations the cabin
door was suddenly flung open and Zeb’s unwieldy
form stood framed in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You kin come out now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Was it Tom’s imagination, or did the mate’s
voice seem less blustery than usual, and his cheeks
not quite so red? Suddenly Lake’s voice came
hailing down from the head of the companion
stairs:</p>

<p class='c006'>“On deck here, Zeb. We’ll be makin’ a landfall
soon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It seemed to Tom that Lake’s voice, too, was
subdued and quiet. It held almost a quaver. But
he had little time for noticing these things, for,
as they emerged from the cabin—with Mr. Chillingworth,
who was now almost recovered—there
came a sudden electrifying hail:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Land ho!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where away?” came Lake’s roar from above.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Two points off’n the sta’bo’d bow,” came back
the answer from somewhere forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the castaways, excited by the sensation
that the end of their strange voyage was in sight,
sprang up the companion stairs, Tom noted one
thing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cabin was empty of life. At the foot of
the stanchion, to which the Chinaman had been
tied, the ropes which had bound him lay in an
untidy tangle. But the man himself was gone,
nor did they ever see him again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch18' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br />THE ISLAND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But the sight that greeted Tom’s eyes as he
emerged on deck speedily drove all other thoughts
from his mind. The wind had died down, and,
although a heavy swell was still running, the sea
was by no means rough. Across the gray waves,
not more than a mile or so from the schooner,
was visible the outlines of a rocky island.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the pall of gray sky, and surrounded by
the leaden, sullen seas, it looked a dismal spot of
land. So far as Tom could make out, it was
craggy and mountainous in the extreme. On the
side by which they were approaching it, the island
was wooded down almost to the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom found the professor at his elbow. He
began to talk to him at once. There was no fear
of any one overhearing them. The crew and the
leaders of the gang were far too busy scanning
the island. In the lee rigging Simon Lake hung
by one arm, while, with his free hand, he held
a pair of glasses to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What land do you suppose that is?” asked
Tom, as the schooner plunged onward toward it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The professor thought a moment before answering.
It was evident he was making some
sort of mental calculation. At last he spoke, and
by this time Mr. Chillingworth was one of the
group about him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should judge it to be one of the group of
islets found to the southward of the Queen Charlotte
group,” he replied. “They are scattered
pretty thickly through these waters, and, as they
are seldom visited except by whalers short of
water or seal poachers, they would naturally afford
an ideal place for men plying the trade that
you have informed me Lake is engaged in.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I agree with you,” said Mr. Chillingworth, in
a low, hopeless sort of tone. “Once on one of
those islands and the chance of our ever being
heard of again is so remote as to be among the
impossibilities. Great heavens, my poor wife——”</p>

<p class='c006'>He broke off with a groan. The professor,
after a quick glance about him to make sure they
were not overheard, laid a comforting hand on
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Brace up, sir,” he said. “I have by no means
given up hope yet. At all events, once on land
we shall have more of a chance to get away than
we would have on board this schooner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His tone seemed to cheer the despondent
rancher considerably. He glanced gratefully at
the philosopher and then said:</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are right, professor. It is foolish to give
way like this when we ought to be bending our
energies in other directions. I shall complain no
more.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” said the professor heartily.
The next instant he turned, as Monday plucked
his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it, Monday?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Boss, me at dese island once in whaler,
Tuesday he here, too. Long time ago,” said the
Kanaka, an excited light burning in his eyes.
“Boss, we tell you something ’bout dese island.
Him very queer island. Back in dem hills, across
dem hills, dey——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush,” cautioned the professor. “Not another
word now, my man. Here comes the head
of this rascally collection of law-breakers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Monday subsided instantly. A vacant look
crept into his eyes, which an instant before had
been dancing excitedly. His companion also relapsed
into apparent listlessness. In many ways
these natives of the South Seas were fully the
equal of any white man in their quick perception
and keen insight. They were quite as much in
possession of the facts concerning Lake and his
crew as were the rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the professor’s sharp eye had noted, Lake
had clambered down from the rigging a few minutes
before. His face bore a satisfied look as he
came toward the castaways.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, thar’s your future home,” he grinned,
as he approached the little group.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps you can tell us if I am correct in
my assumption that the island is one of the Queen
Charlotte group off the coast of Canada?” inquired
the professor, adjusting his spectacles and
turning to Lake.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I ain’t sayin’,” was the sullen rejoinder. “It’s
enough fer yer ter know thet we’re bound fer
thet island, and ye’re a mighty lucky lot not to
be at the bottom of the sea at this minnit. I
tell yer I hed a hard time persuading Zeb Hunt
and ther crew not ter finish yer off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom shuddered at the rascal’s calm tone. He
spoke without the slightest concern. As he gazed
at the rapacious face of the leader of the Chinese
runners, Tom did not doubt that the unfortunate
Chinaman at that moment reposed where,
according to Lake, Zeb Hunt and the crew would
have liked to see them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the schooner drew closer to the island, Tom
perceived what Lake had noticed through the
glasses some time before. This was, that on the
beach, flying from a tall, white flagstaff, was a
square of red bunting. What this meant he was
presently to find out in an odd manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake and Hunt went below as the schooner
approached the island. Their heads were close
together in deep consultation as they entered the
companionway. Tom wondered what they could
be discussing—the fate of the castaways likely.</p>

<p class='c006'>The island, seen at closer range as the schooner
drew nearer, appeared even more uninviting than
it had from the distance. Tall, bare hills, rock-ribbed
and cloven with deep crevasses, ran back
from its shores, piling up to a mass of rugged
peaks and inaccessible-looking precipices. At the
foot of these hills—or rather mountains in miniature—was
a dense growth of dark, melancholy
looking trees, of dark green and blackish foliage.
These Tom learned later were mostly pine trees
and other conifers.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the part of the island immediately
about the flagstaff, though, that interested him
the most. Here quite a clearing seemed to have
been made in the dense forest, and a cluster of
rough huts could be seen, with several figures
moving about. Against the dark background the
red flag floated out like a flame.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the others stood in a group at the rail
watching all this, Tom retired to a seat on the
edge of the cabin skylight. As it had grown
warm with the dropping of the wind, one of the
sections of the light was open, and through it
the voices of Hunt and Lake drifted up from the
cabin as they sat talking.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We won’t be able to lose much time, cap,”
Tom could hear Zeb say; “the red flag is up and
that means that the steamer has called with another
load of Chinks and gone away again. The
sooner we run them through the better, more especially
as Chillingworth is out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, thar’s no hurry, is thar?” inquired
Lake. “I’d like a bit of a run ashore thar to git
my head in shape again. Then, too, thar’s thet
gold back in ther hills. I mean ter sic’ that professer
onter thet, Zeb.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You still think thet’s gold-bearing rock,
then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure uv it. Ef only it is, we’ll get rid of
this crew uv ours, Zeb, and you and I ’ull chuck
this Chink running business and settle down ter
mining. It’s not so dangerous, an’ almost as
profitable.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” came Hunt’s voice, “I’ve only one
thing ter say, pervisions is short, an’ ef ther
steamer has landed another bunch of Chinks, the
less time we keep ’em ashore the better. Then,
too, this wife of Chillingworth’s is bound ter kick
up a turribul rumpus when she finds her husband
is gone. All things considered, I say let’s get the
job over and done with, as quick as possible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I dunno but what ye’re right,” rejoined Lake,
“and——”</p>

<p class='c006'>But here the noise of the crew, as under the
orders of Zeb’s assistant, a little bow-legged fellow,
with a fringe of beard under his chin, they
began to work the schooner on another tack,
drowned all other sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom arose from his seat, not wishing to court
discovery by remaining there longer. He felt
that he had overheard an important conversation,
though. In the event of Lake’s and Zeb’s
having to make a quick run back to the coast,
perhaps it would be possible in some way to
smuggle themselves on board, or at least work
out some plan to get back to their own people.
Then, too, there had been some hope in what the
Kanaka had said. Evidently he and his companion
knew something about the island which
was of high importance to persons in their position.</p>

<p class='c006'>Altogether Tom felt quite heartened compared
to his despondency of a short time before.</p>

<p class='c006'>By dinner time the schooner had been worked
quite close to the island, and when they came on
deck after the meal they found that not more
than a few hundred yards separated her from
the shore. While they had been down in the
cabin she had slipped in through a passage in a
sort of reef that extended from the shore. She
now lay in deep, calm water, scarcely moving.
As Zeb shouted the command and the anchor
rattled and roared to the bottom of the lagoon,
several boats put off from the shore and came
toward them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom looked toward the rough, precipitous
shores with a strange mingling of excitement and
apprehension. What lay in front of them on
that island? Was it to prove the scene of their
indefinite imprisonment in practical slavery to
Lake and his crew?</p>

<p class='c006'>The boy could not but think that the outlook
appeared as sombre as the leaden skies, the drab,
rocky hills, and the sullen, gray sea outside the
reef. But he determined to put a brave face on
it, and began to watch, with some interest, the
boats pulling toward them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch19' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br />THE ROCKING STONE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It is not our intention to detail all that happened
during the first week of the castaways’
stay on the island. Soon after the schooner anchored
they were landed in boats and found themselves
in the midst of a strange community indeed.
As had appeared from the sea, the collection
of huts—roughly built of driftwood and
roofed with anything that came handy—ran almost
down to the margin of the sea. Behind
them were great thickets of thorny, straggly
brush, in places higher than a man’s head. This,
they learned afterward, was considered to be impenetrable.
Rumor about the camp had it,
though, that Simon Lake and his mate had managed
to traverse it, and had formed paths among
the dense growth which were only known to
themselves. However that might be, nobody
ever appeared to enter it for any purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The camp, or collection of shanties, therefore,
was to all intents and purposes, an island within
an island. The great shed or barn-like structure
which Tom had noted from the sea was, so it
now transpired, a sort of detaining shed for the
Chinamen until they could be shipped south to
the States. It was fitted with numerous bunks and
rough cooking places of brick, made from a kind
of sun-dried clay. When the party from the
schooner came ashore it was occupied by some
hundred or more Chinese, who came curiously
to the doors and gaped at the newcomers till some
of Lake’s men roughly drove them back.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Tom, he could not but admire the system
which the rough New Englander seemed to
have instilled into the working of the affairs of
the island. There was, it appeared, a regular
division of labor, the men taking it in turns to go
south with the Chinese and to stay and guard
the island and receive the steamer when it came
from the north with a fresh installment of yellow
men. In this way Lake had effectually succeeded
in silencing all grumbling over unequal
division of tasks.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake himself was in absolute command of
everything and everybody. It could be seen that
his rough crew feared as well as admired him.
As everywhere where several men are gathered
together, some of the islanders were of a better
sort than others. With one of these fellows Tom
soon struck up an acquaintanceship. He was a
man who had been with Lake on sealing cruises
and had in this way drifted into his present life.
He confided to Tom that he would be glad to
get out of it, but that Lake had made them all
swear, under threat of terrible penalties, never
to desert the band.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have not referred to our party as prisoners,
for in the literal sense of the word they
were not. As will have been seen, there was no
need to surround them with the constant guard
and surveillance that Lake’s gang would have
been compelled to exercise elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c006'>Indeed, every one of them realized bitterly that
they were more effectually in captivity than if
they had been encompassed by stone walls and iron
bars. From the bleak, barren islet there was literally
no chance of escape, unless they had
sought freedom by utilizing an airship. True,
the schooner lay at anchor in the little bay, and
they were a numerous enough party to have
worked her, for both the Kanakas were expert
seamen. But the beach was patroled day and
night, and, although there was nobody on board
the schooner to repel them, yet she was, to all intents
and purposes, as inaccessible as if she had
swarmed with men and guns.</p>

<p class='c006'>True to his word, Lake had set them all to
work. Hitherto he had kept a sort of rough set
of accounts. It now became Mr. Chillingworth’s
duty to tabulate and assort these and enter the
various transactions of Lake’s unusual “business”
in different books. Then, too, the provisions of
so considerable a party called for a good deal
of bookkeeping. The rancher welcomed the
work, however, and plunged into it with avidity.
It kept him from thinking, he explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Tom, employment of an unique sort
was found for him. It has been mentioned that
Zeb Hunt had complained of a shortage of provisions.
It was, in fact, the case that food on
the island was scarce and daily diminishing. At
the time the party landed the men were already
beginning to grumble. Lake’s presence at first
had the effect of quieting them, but within a
few days the discontented mutterings broke out
afresh.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was this condition of things that occasioned
Tom’s employment in a strange occupation for
such a place. The Bungalow Boy was appointed
by Simon Lake storekeeper and purveyor of provisions.
He had a hut provided for him in which
he kept his stock—all the provisions on the island.
These he doled out three times a day, giving to
each man his exact portion. It was no sinecure
of a position, either. Tom, who, of course, was
in no way responsible for the arrangement or for
the shortage of food, had to meet many black
looks and insolent threats as he gave each man
his share, and no more, in the measures Lake
had provided for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>For an assistant he had Professor Dingle’s boy,
and for the first time in his life that youth was
kept so active that he had little time to ask foolish
questions. At the time Tom assumed charge
of the store the main provisions left in the colony
consisted of flour, coffee, oatmeal, a little bacon,
and some spices and sugar. For meat the men
had to depend on the fish they caught—luckily,
they were plentiful. Lake had, at one time, maintained
a flock of sheep and goats, but these had
long since been used up.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Professor Dingle and the two Kanakas,
no occupation had, as yet, been found for
them, but they helped at numerous small tasks
about the colony. In return for their services
the castaways had been given a hut in the rear of
the storeroom. Here they ate and slept and indulged
in long talks, none of them caring to
mingle with the rough characters of the colony,
with the exception of Tom’s friend, whose name
was Lucas Tryon. This man was always a welcome
visitor, and he more than repaid what entertainment
they were able to give him by the
things he told them about the island and the ways
and customs of its dwellers.</p>

<p class='c006'>One morning while they were still lingering
over the remains of their scant breakfast, Lake
himself slouched in. His wound had now quite
healed. Only a white scar remained to show
where he would always carry a mark.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, perfesser,” he remarked, “ef you air
ready, I reckin I’ve got a job fer you ter tackle
ter-day. Come ter think uv it, ther rest uv you
might come along. Zeb ’ull look arter ther store,
an’ he can take care of ther kid, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The professor at first demurred to this, but
Lake’s manner showed that he was not to be
trifled with. Whatever he had in his mind to do
he evidently meant to accomplish without delay.
It is a curious light on the character of Zeb Hunt
that, rough, brutal man that he was, he had become
seemingly much attached to the professor’s
little lad and was never irritated at his endless
questions. The professor, therefore, felt less reluctance
to leave the lad behind them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soon after, with some of the rapidly lessening
stock of provisions with them, the party, at
Simon Lake’s heels, struck into the brush. Behind
them in the little settlement were black looks
which Tom could not help but notice. But he
had grown so used to this in the store that he
paid little attention to them. Once or twice the
sullen demeanor of the men had seemed on the
point of flaring out into actual mutiny, but, so
far, Lake had been able to quell it. It did not
occur to Tom that things were rapidly reaching
a crisis.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the camp the brush appeared to be impenetrable.
But under Simon Lake’s guidance
they soon found themselves on a narrow trail
which wound steeply off up the overgrown hillside.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake said nothing, but stolidly plodded on till
he reached a spot where the trail opened out
into a small clearing—a natural space in the
midst of the dense, rank growth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sit down,” he said, motioning to some rocks
which cropped out of the ground here and there.
“Afore we go any farther I’m goin’ ter tell yer
why I brought yer along on this cruise. Back in
these mountains Zeb Hunt and I, on a hunting
trip some time back, stumbled across what I believe
are gold-bearing rocks. That’s what I
wanted ther perfesser along fer. He’s a scientific
gent, and kin tell in a minnit whether er not
they be worth going arter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How far is this place from here?” inquired
the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not more than an hour’s tramp by the trail
I’m going’ ter take yer,” was the rejoinder. “I
jes’ thought, though, that I’d stop and make it
all clear to yer whar we air bound fer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I fail to see what difference it makes since we
are under compulsion to accompany you, anyhow,”
said Mr. Chillingworth, rather bitterly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake looked at him sharply.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal,” he said slowly, “thar’s five of you and
only one uv me. But,” and a slow smile crept
over his face as he gazed at his belt in which
hung two revolvers, “somehow I don’t believe it
’ud be healthy fer you ter try conclusions with
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke he shouldered his rifle and, changing
his tone the next minute, said briskly:</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s for’ard, then?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Forward by all means,” rejoined the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>They all, except the silent Kanakas, echoed his
words. At any rate, this adventure promised to
be out of the ordinary run of things, and there
was just a chance that it might prove the stepping-stone
to the way of escape for which they
were always on the lookout.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must have been high noon when they
emerged from the rough, rocky ground in which
the brush found root and entered upon scenery
of a totally different character to any they had
yet encountered on the island. The denseness of
the brush, which had prevented their looking
about them, had concealed from them the fact
that in the past hour of their march they had
been rising very rapidly.</p>

<p class='c006'>They now found themselves in a barren sort
of tableland, which looked sun-baked and drear.
Its surface was seamed and cracked as if by volcanic
action in the past. Almost directly ahead
of them, as it appeared, towered the ragged
steeple-like peaks which were such conspicuous
objects from the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>But a closer inspection proved that, as a matter
of fact, the peaks were separated from them by a
gulf or chasm, which, as a remarkable natural
phenomenon, merits some brief description. A
few steps across the arid tableland brought them
to its edge. Tom could not repress a shudder as
he gazed into the fathomless rift. Seared by
volcanic fires till its sides were of a reddish, angry
hue, the abyss itself seemed to have likewise
been the result of some tremendous convulsion of
nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>It cleft the island into two parts like a crack in
a plate, for it extended clear across it from one
side to the other. While they were gazing down
into the depths of this horrid profundity, Monday
gave a sudden cry, and pointed to a large
rock of conical form which upreared itself like a
huge obelisk on the edge of the precipice not far
from where they stood.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Matura Seral!” they heard him exclaim to
Tuesday, who was gazing at the object with
wrapped interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have seen that stone before, Monday?”
asked the professor, reading aright the expression
of the two South Sea natives.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, boss. Many time when here with whaler.
They call him Matura Seral—in our language
that mean Rocking Stone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A rocking stone, eh?” echoed the professor,
beaming behind his spectacles. “One of those
truly interesting glacial freaks.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He hastened forward, following Lake, who had
already started for the stone, of the existence
of which he seemed perfectly well aware. At
any rate, it was not an unfamiliar object to him,
for as he reached its side he laid one of his hands
upon it, and, to the amazement of the rest, they
saw the mighty mass of stone actually quiver and
sway. Yet so perfectly poised was it on the edge
of the chasm, where the same convulsion that
had caused the rift had probably deposited it, that
in the countless ages it had stood there it had not
moved from its base.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, gents all,” said Lake, as they came up,
“here’s whar we stop.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So it seems,” said Mr. Chillingworth; “but
where is that gold mine you brought us here to
examine?”</p>

<p class='c006'>For reply Lake pointed across the gulf at their
feet. Exactly opposite to where they stood they
could now see on the wall of a precipice facing
them a narrow ledge. At one end of this ledge
was what appeared to be the mouth of a cave.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thar,” said Lake, indicating the opening;
“thar’s the place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How on earth do you expect to cross this
gulch?” gasped the professor, looking at Lake, as
if he were in doubt as to whether the fellow was
in his right wits.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake exerted a little more of his great strength
and gave the rocking stone a great shove. It
bent outward and dipped over the gorge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hyar’s haow we’ll cross,” he said. “It’s a
bridge put hyar by either God or the Devil, but
it’s come in handy fer Simon Lake.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c007'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br />BURIED ALIVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was Monday who broke the silence that followed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dat right, boss,” he said. “In old time me
come here wid whaler we go on stone lots of
time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All same stone in our country,” added Tuesday.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake stared at them with a dropped jaw. It
was plain to see he was astonished.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ve crossed by this stone?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p class='c006'>But Monday shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” he said, “but some time we come here
and rock on him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>For some reason or other Bully Banjo seemed
mightily relieved at this.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal,” he said, “it’s a simple thing, arter all.
Jes’ a matter of balance. But I tell yer it took
nerve ther first time me an’ Zeb crossed over,
although we knew the rock would work—at least,
the sealer wot told us about ther mine told us
that ther thing was safe. And now, perfesser, ef
you’ve no objection, we’ll jes’ send one of yer
blacks across since they’re used ter it, an’ when
they land safe on the ledge it’ll give ther rest
of you courage.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Monday, do you mind attempting this?” asked
the professor. The kind-hearted scientist would
rather have tried the experiment himself—risky
as it seemed—than compel one of his servants to
go unwillingly. But he was under no such compulsion.
Monday gave a broad grin that showed
his white teeth in an expression of almost childish
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me like go, boss,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right, then. Up with yer,” ordered Lake
brusquely. “I don’t want ter fool away too much
time hyar, but I jes’ had ter know about thet
gold afore we sail.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you mean to sail soon?” asked the
professor, as Monday clambered up the rough sides
of the rock.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ter-morrer, I reckon,” was the rejoinder.
“Yer see thet them boys uv mine are getting
pretty ugly. Thet’s one reason why I don’t
want to spend too long a time hyarabouts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good heaven!” exclaimed the professor at the
thought of his boy left behind in the camp. “You
surely don’t fear an outbreak of trouble while
you’re gone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” rejoined Lake. “Frankly I don’t, but
you kain’t mos’ genally allers tell. Howsomever,
I kalkerlate thet Zeb Hunt kin tackle any trouble
thet comes along.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I sincerely hope so,” said the professor, somewhat
reassured. He then turned with the rest to
watch with rapt attention what was transpiring
on the rocking stone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Monday had now almost reached the summit,
and under his weight the big stone was tipping
gradually outward till the part of it he had
reached hung above the gulch. It descended as
steadily as the arm of a semaphore, and, although
the experience appeared to be a terrifying one,
the black was smiling as though he enjoyed it.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the point of the stone—which, as has been
said, was cone-shaped—touched the rock ledge
Monday nimbly leaped from it and stood on the
narrow shelf of stone. The fellow, like most
islanders, was as agile as a goat. He smiled
broadly back at his companions who, however,
were not looking at him, but at the stone, which,
relieved of its weight, now tilted back into position
again as if actuated by some hidden machinery.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wonder how that old sealer felt the first time
he tried it?” mused the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kind er skeery like, I reckon,” said Simon
Lake. “I guess he——”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Tom interrupted him with a sharp question.
It was odd, but the idea which had just
struck the boy had not as yet occurred to the
others.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do you get back again?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal, yer see thar’s a trail up thet cliff that
leads to ther top. Frum thar thar’s a path thet
leads to a cove the ’tother side of the island.
Thar’s mighty shallow water close in shore thar,
so we kain’t bring ther schooner round, but Zeb
Hunt an’ me keep a boat thar so that when we
get through in ther cave we’ll cut across the other
half of ther island and row home in ther boat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>That solved the mystery which for an instant
had perplexed them all. Lake, who seemed to be
in high spirits, confided to them that all these
secrets had been contained in the map of the place
the old sealer had given him. Not knowing
Lake’s character, our party wondered a good deal
at his flow of spirits for—except when he had his
banjo in hand—he was generally taciturn and
sullen. They did not know that danger acted on
him like wine on some men. Affairs at the camp
were far more critical than he had let them know.
That morning Lake had received a note threatening
his life if he did not immediately set sail.
It was characteristic of the man that this only
made him delay the more.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The varmints. I’ll teach ’em,” he had muttered,
as he tore the missive into shreds.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the realization that mutiny was imminent
had been the real reason for his visit that morning
to the gold-bearing rocks. He wished to
make sure that they were as valuable as he believed,
and if they proved to be so he was quite
cold-blooded enough to sail off and abandon the
mutineers to their fate. Returning to the island
at some later date, he would ransack it of its
precious metal at his leisure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tuesday followed his fellow-countryman over.
He made the passage in perfect safety, fairly
squealing with delight as the big rock tipped
with him. Then came Tom’s turn. He also
made the crossing without accident, as did the
professor and Mr. Chillingworth. Simon Lake
came last, carrying his weapons and a sack of
tools which he had brought—a drill and such implements—the
better for boring and obtaining
samples.</p>

<p class='c006'>When they all stood on the ledge and watched
the big stone rise majestically for the last time,
Tom was conscious of a sinking sensation. What
if something had happened to the trail—if it were
blocked or something. They would inevitably be
prisoners till death came to their relief. However,
there was no time to dwell on gloomy
thoughts like these.</p>

<p class='c006'>While they had been making the passage of
the gulch a change had set in in the weather.
It had been bright when they set out, but now
dark clouds had rolled up, obscuring the sun and
casting gloom into the depths of the crevasse
upon whose edge they stood. There was an oppressive
feeling, too, in the air.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thar’s a storm of some kind comin’ up,” commented
Lake, gazing overhead at the driving
clouds.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thunder?” asked the professor sniffing the
heavy, sultry air.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Looks like it. Ef it is one, we’ll be glad of
shelter. We git some hummers daown in these
parts, I kin tell yer. They don’t come often, but
when they do, by Chowder! they deliver ’em in
large packages.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke a few heavy drops of rain fell.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on. Better hurry for the cave,” cried
Lake, hastening forward with his sack of tools.
They followed him, keeping as close to the cliff-face
as they could. The ledge was narrow, and
it was unpleasant to think of what a misstep
would result in.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cave proved to be a large one and
reached back some distance into the rock. Its
floor was littered with bowlders and earth, where
Lake and Zeb Hunt had carried on their prospecting
operations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The professor picked up a bit of the stuff. In
the dim light they could see the dull glint of
metal in it. Lake watched the scientist curiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Waal,” he said, “haow is it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I cannot tell positively,” was the rejoinder,
“but if it is all like this, it is worth considerable
per ton.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will she run two thousand dollars to the ton?”
asked Lake curiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>The professor shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Impossible to say without adequate assaying
implements.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Make me out a list of wot yer want and when
I come back from ther next run I’ll bring ’em
with me,” promised Lake.</p>

<p class='c006'>To Tom this speech seemed particularly ominous.
It meant that there was no intention on
Lake’s part of their escaping.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here’s a good boring,” said Lake presently.
He drew a lantern from the tool bag and lit it,
holding it up against a place at the back of the
cave which had been pecked at with a pick. To
do this he had to squat down almost doubled up
in the cramped space. This brought the tip of
one of his pistol holsters against an outcropping
rock and the weapon fell to the ground unnoticed
by Lake, but instantly seen by Tom, who stood
close behind. Without any very definite idea of
what he meant to do with it, the boy slipped it inside
his shirt. Perhaps he would have some opportunity
to find use for it, he thought vaguely.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lake, earnestly examining bits of rock and
handing them up to the professor, did not notice
the loss of his weapon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly there came an ominous growling
sound from outside. It was thunder. The storm
was rapidly nearing them then.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gee whillakers!” exclaimed Lake, suddenly
springing erect. “Ef I ain’t forgotten ter go an’
look fer thet signal.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you mean?” asked the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, frum ther top uv this cliff yer kin see
ther camp with field-glasses. I brought mine
along fer thet purpose. Afore I left I agreed
with Zeb thet in the event uv trubble he wuz ter
hoist a red flag. Ef everything wuz all right, he
was to run up the blue one. I’m goin’ up thar
now afore ther storm makes it too thick.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He hastened from the cave and, making his
way along the ledge, began to mount the face of
the cliff by a narrow stairway cut at a sharp incline
in the face of the acclivity. Presently he
vanished at the summit. It was then that Tom,
with shining eyes, turned to the others.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Our chance to escape has come!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do you make that out?” asked Mr. Chillingworth
listlessly.</p>

<p class='c006'>For reply Tom drew out his pistol.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We can make Lake prisoner on his return,”
he said eagerly, “and then make our way across
the island to the cove in which, as he told us, he
had hidden the boat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good gracious boy!” cried the professor excitedly.
“That’s a good idea. A splendid one,
but—what about my boy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom, who in his excitement had quite forgotten
that the son and heir of the Dingle fortunes
was in the care of Zeb Hunt, looked thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, we must get him,” he said. “I’ll
tell you,” he cried, his eyes flashing at the adventurous
daring of the plan he was about to propose,
“we’ll make Lake prisoner and take him
along with us. With him in our power, we will
be in a position to make terms with the rascals.
We can conceal him somewhere and refuse to
give him up till we get our liberty and the boy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps to any one less desperately situated
the plan would have appealed only as the forlornest
kind of a forlorn hope. But to our party it
seemed feasible, and even excellently practicable.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as they stood discussing it in the cave
mouth, there came a sudden blinding flash of
lightning. Involuntarily they all stepped back
within the cavern. The clap of thunder that followed
the electrical display shook the cliff till it
vibrated again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wow! this is a real storm, sure enough!” exclaimed
Tom. “I never saw such lightning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And no rain,” said the professor; “that makes
it doubly bad. These dry electrical storms are
always more severe than those accompanied by a
heavy downpour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he spoke there came another blinding flash,
accompanied by a terrific peal of thunder. But
the figure of Lake could now be seen coming
down the cliff-face on his way back to the cave.
The time to put their plan into execution had arrived.
Amid the turmoil of the elements, they
discussed it. It was agreed that Tom, hiding
behind a big fragment of rock at the entrance of
the cave mouth, was to level his pistol at the unsuspecting
desperado as he appeared. He was
then to be disarmed and tied, and the rest of their
arrangements they left in an undecided condition
till the first part of the daring program was carried
out. The main thing to do, so all hands
agreed, was to capture Lake.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nearer and nearer came the unsuspecting
leader of the Chinese runners. Tom crouched
back into his place of concealment as the other
came on. The rest stood close behind him. They
hardly dared to breathe as the footsteps of the
man they wished to capture drew closer.</p>

<p class='c006'>As his form was framed in the cave mouth
Tom sprang erect, holding the pistol level and
pointed straight at Lake’s head. He saw the
rascal grow white under his tan and open his
mouth as if about to speak. But at the same
instant there came a crash that seemed as if
heaven and earth were being devoured in one
vast catastrophe. At the same time a sheet of
dazzling, burning white flame enveloped them.
The figures in the cave mouth were illumined in
its livid glare as if cut out of black paper. Crash
followed crash. Another and another. A sensation
like that of the pricking of myriad pin
points ran through them. The blue lightning
darted, hissing viciously about them, bathing
them in living electricity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bewildered and stunned, Tom saw Lake’s figure
reel and fall backward, clutching at the rock
as he fell. The boy sprang forward to catch him
and save him from falling into the abyss below,
when a crash that dwarfed the others fairly
stopped him in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c006'>There came a mighty splitting, rending sound
and Tom, looking upward in the direction from
whence it came, saw the form of the great rocking
stone swaying drunkenly on the bed in which
it had rested securely through the ages.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly the great rock mass toppled out, its
black form impending between the lad and the
sky. The noise of its falling reverberated above
the shriek of the storm and the thunder’s loudest
roar.</p>

<p class='c006'>Instinctively Tom tottered backward as it fell.
Stunned, half deafened, and numb from the lightning,
he reeled like a sick man. But even above
it all, he could hear Lake’s wild death-shriek
ringing out as he plunged backward.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next instant there was a shock that seemed
to shake the cliff to its mighty foundations. The
dim light of the storm-shrouded day was blocked
out, and at the same moment Tom lost consciousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>But to the others there came no such merciful
blotting out of the strange horror of the situation.
In the very act of overpowering their
enemy, they had, in turn, been overwhelmed by
a crushing disaster.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rocking stone, driven and unseated by a
terrific thunderbolt, had lost its delicate balance
and toppled from its base into the abyss.</p>

<p class='c006'>In its fall it had wedged across the narrow
gorge, blocking completely with the weight of
tons of stone the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p class='c006'>The castaways of Bully Banjo’s island were
buried alive beyond hope of escape.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br />MR. CHILLINGWORTH FIRES—AND MISSES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As is often the case where a disaster so complete
has overtaken men, their very powers of
speech seem to be taken from them. We read of
men entombed in mines sitting silently awaiting
the end, and of the silence in which disabled submarines
have sunk to the bed of the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was so in this case. After a brief examination
had shown them, what in fact they already
knew, that tons of stone blocked their escape from
the cave, they had relapsed into apparent apathy.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one even appeared to notice Tom, who
presently came to himself and stood dizzily upright.
The lamp still burned in the rear of the
cavern, shedding a dim, yellow light. But outside
its rays the place was pitchy black. The weight
of the rock that had fallen blocking the cave
mouth had also shut out all sound of the fury of
the storm—so that the place was as silent as a
graveyard.</p>

<p class='c006'>In answer to Tom’s questions the professor told
him in a dull, listless voice, what had occurred.
Tom was a plucky lad and had faced a good many
dangers without flinching, but as he realized their
position his heart sank, and he felt a queer,
sickish feeling, that, if it were not real panic,
approximated it pretty closely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then there is no hope?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom heard the professor to the end and then
spoke in the same dull, toneless voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A convulsion of nature seated that stone
there,” he said; “another one displaced it. It is
hoping too much that a third will occur and
free us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then we must sit here till we die?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Chillingworth’s voice struck in. It was as
lifeless as the tones of the others.</p>

<p class='c006'>As for Monday and Tuesday they took no part
in the conversation, but sat moodily in the rear
of the cave accepting their fate in a stoical manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am afraid that the only thing for us to do
is to die like men and Americans,” said the professor
bravely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, no! no! I cannot die like this. I must get
out! Oh, heaven, I won’t die like this!”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he shouted thus incoherently the rancher
dashed himself against the rock that sealed the
cave mouth. Tom started up to drag him from
the entrance and prevent his uselessly bruising
and cutting himself. But the professor laid a
hand on the boy’s arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Leave him alone,” he said; “poor fellow. Life
was good to him. He will be quieter when that
paroxysm is over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And so it proved. The rancher’s desperate fit
left him weak and exhausted. He sank down on
a bit of rock, his head buried in his hand. But
his heaving shoulders told what he was enduring.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom felt that he, too, would have liked to leap
to his feet and hurl his body at the imprisoning
rock, but he restrained himself by an effort.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If I am to die, I’ll at least try to die as a
man should,” thought the boy to himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>For some time more they sat in gloomy silence.
The only sound that broke the hush was that of
Chillingworth’s sobs. Presently the professor
arose, and not with any real sense of finding anything,
commenced, with the aid of the lantern,
a thorough examination of the cave. But if he
had ever expected to find any outlet, he was disappointed.
The place was without any other
aperture than the one the fallen mass of stone had
sealed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you think that any one will ever find our—our—bodies
in this dreadful place?” said Tom,
as the professor, abandoning his search with a
sigh, rejoined the boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am afraid not,” said the scientist gloomily.
“Why, what did you have in mind, my boy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, I have a bit of chalk here,” said Tom.
“I thought we might scrawl up our names and
the date and what happened on the walls of the
cave. It would be a record in case—in case—”
his voice shook, but he controlled it bravely—“they
ever found us,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At any rate, it will be something to do,”
agreed the professor, falling in with the idea
heartily. “But why not leave a more complete
message—an account of our strange captivity,
and so on? I have a pencil somewhere, and a
tablet for making scientific notes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good!” rejoined Tom. “You write the lengthy
account while I chalk up a shorter record on the
rocks.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He turned toward the wall, looking about for a
smooth place to letter their last message upon,
while the professor began fumbling in his pockets
for his pencil. The implement did not seem to be
handy. At any rate, the man of science explored
all his outside pockets without result. Then he
began on his inside ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly, while he was feeling about inside his
coat, he gave a cry that echoed oddly through the
silences of the sealed cave. So sharp and so peculiar
was the tone that Chillingworth looked up
from between his hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you found the pencil?” asked Tom, in a
steady voice, turning from his work with the
chalk and coming toward the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next instant he felt a sharp chilling of his
senses. The professor’s mind had undoubtedly
given way under the strain of the terrible situation.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was creeping toward Tom, holding something
with the utmost care between his long fingers.
He was regarding this object, which, Tom
thought from its shape, must be a pencil, with
smiles of what seemed insane delight and foolish,
meaningless gibberings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the matter, professor?” asked Tom,
stepping briskly toward him and adopting a tone
like one would use toward a child. “Come, brace
up, sir. Don’t give way!”</p>

<p class='c006'>For the professor was now giggling hysterically.
The Kanakas, sullenly crouched by the lamp
in a far corner, regarded him curiously. Monday
tapped his forehead significantly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tom, my boy,” breathed the professor, laying
a bony hand on the boy’s shoulder—“Tom, I’m
not crazy! Listen to me.” Then evidently making
a strong effort to control himself, he sank his
voice into a hard, level tone: “We have a chance
of escape!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom gave an amazed gasp. Words—he had
none to fit this staggering statement.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you see this little tube?” the professor
went on.</p>

<p class='c006'>He held up the long, thin, cylindrical object
which Tom had mistaken for a pencil. He now
saw that it was a glass tube about ten inches long
and filled with a yellow, pasty-looking substance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that tube are four ounces of my explosive,”
whispered the professor, his eyes burning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The same stuff that blew Mrs. Bijur’s roof
up?” gasped Tom, but without a hint of laughter
in his voice or on his face. He began to see what
was in the wind now.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” was the rejoinder; “at least what exploded
there was not more than a hundredth part
of this tube, and it was not of anything like similar
strength, being diluted. I had this explosive
with me on the yawl, thinking that I might use it
in geological work—diluted, of course. When the
collision came I recollect seizing up this tube of
my invention and thrusting it into my coat. In
this rush of recent events I had forgotten it till
this moment, when, in my search for a pencil, I
encountered it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you mean to do with it?” asked Tom,
in the same breathless tones. Without knowing
it, he was clutching the professor in the intensity
of his excitement and eager hope.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I mean to attempt to blow up the rock that
blocks the entrance of this cave,” was the calm
reply. “We have tools—a drill, and we can use
that long stick I cut as a walking staff, for a
tampon to drive the charge home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But how are we to fire it?” asked Tom. “We
have no fuse and no means of getting one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Confound it!” exclaimed the professor, his
hopes dashed to the lowest ebb once more. “What
a fellow I am to forget details. What are we to
do? Here we have the means of escape within
our grasp almost, only to see them snatched away
by such an unlucky chance as this. In any event,
an ordinary fuse would do us no good. My explosive
only ignites by detonation—in other
words, by being dealt a hard blow. If only we
had a fulminate of mercury cap——”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Might as well wish that the stone hadn’t
fallen,” said Tom briskly. “I tell you what, Professor,
let us start those Kanakas drilling a hole
in the rock where it seems thinnest. While they
are doing it we, perhaps, can think of some plan
to explode the charge.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a striking example of the effect of action
on men that the Kanakas, once they were set to
work, became far less gloomy. They tapped the
rock eagerly to ascertain, while the professor listened
to see, where it sounded the least solid. He
finally selected a place and ordered the two South
Sea natives to commence their bore there. They
at once set to work at the task, while Mr. Chillingworth,
who had been roused from his lethargy
by even this remote chance of gaining freedom,
talked over eagerly with the others the possibility
of hitting upon a way to explode the charge
and shatter the stone without using a detonator.
The rancher had had considerable experience with
dynamite and giant powder on his ranch, where
he had blown up scores of big tree roots, so that
his contributions to the discussion were intelligent
ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last he sprang to his feet with a sharp cry:
“I’ve got it. I know how we can explode that
stuff.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The others looked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How?” asked the professor bluntly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By hitting it with a bullet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I mean what I say. We have a pistol and
two of us at least are good shots. We will place
that explosive in the hole in the rock when it is
drilled and then fire it by striking it with a bullet
from the revolver, Tom secured when Lake
dropped it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is a good idea,” said the professor dryly,
“but when the explosion comes what is to become
of us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Chillingworth’s enthusiasm vanished like the
effervescence of a wet rocket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t think of that,” he said. “There is a
chance that we might be blown to pieces by the
same explosion that rends the rock.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perfectly correct,” agreed the professor, with
a curious ring in his voice, “but not necessary.
The force of my explosive, when confined, is invariably
downward and inward. That is to say,
in this case if we bore a hole at a steep angle into
the rock, we may be able to shatter part of it
without hurting ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Kanakas were at once set to work boring
another hole slanting in the proposed direction.
When this was accomplished, the professor gingerly
placed the tube of high explosive within the
aperture and announced that, so far as he was
concerned, all was ready.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hold on a minute,” exclaimed Tom, as a sudden
idea struck him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Drawing out his chalk, he marked a ring
round the mouth of the bore.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There,” he exclaimed, “that makes a good
target and the hole containing the explosive is the
bull’s-eye.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hitting which in this case may mean annihilation,
swift and terrible,” said the professor
dryly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We must make up our minds to take that
chance,” said Mr. Chillingworth firmly, and Tom
was rejoiced to see that the rancher’s nerve had
come back.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you take the first shot?” he asked, handing
the pistol to the rancher.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Kanakas gazed on curiously. They had
been told of the daring attempt that was to be
made, and had no objection. A shrug of the
shoulders was their way of saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>“As well death one way as another.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Chillingworth accepted the pistol and
weighed it curiously to ascertain its balance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A nice little weapon,” he said, in a calm voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think we had all better shake hands,” said
the professor, “before we retire to the rear of
the cave.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Seriously the trio imprisoned in the living
tomb shook hands and then started back to the
extreme end of the cavern. Just before they did
this, the lantern had been placed where its light
would fall on the target. This left the rear part
of the cave in blackness. Perhaps they each
were glad of this. Tom knew he had no wish to
look at the others’ faces, although he hoped that
no trace of fear showed on his own.</p>

<p class='c006'>Packing themselves as compactly as possible
against the rear wall of the place, they fell into
silence as Chillingworth made ready to fire. Only
by a constant wetting of his lips with the tip of
his tongue did the rancher betray his excitement.
Tom could feel his pulses pounding and his heart
beating till it seemed it would burst his ribs. The
sweat rolled off his face. He wondered how the
professor felt. Would Chillingworth never stop
his everlasting balancing of the pistol and aiming
of it at the target? What would Jack——?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The rancher’s exclamation was followed by a
sharp report, all the more deafening for the tiny
space in which they were confined. Tom threw
himself on his face, and so did the others, waiting
a second and a more terrible shock.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it didn’t come. For once in his life Chillingworth,
who was rated a first-class shot, had
missed his target.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch22' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br />MUTINY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Flunked!” choked out the rancher, with a bitter
little laugh. He handed the pistol to Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here, you try. I’m free to admit that I
haven’t the grit to go through with it again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom took the pistol almost mechanically. His
disappointment was as keen as that of the others.
They had keyed themselves up to the last notch
of courage and determination, it seemed, and now
it was all to be done over again. No wonder that
the Kanakas’ reserve gave way under the strain,
and that they sat chattering hysterically as Tom
dully examined the chambers of the revolver.</p>

<p class='c006'>Right then he made a discovery that startled
him. Their next attempt would be their last in
very fact. Evidently Lake had been firing off
his pistol before they set out for the hills—target
practice was a common diversion of his,—and
only two shells had been left in the chamber when
Tom appropriated the weapon. Chillingworth
had fired one, leaving a solitary cartridge undischarged.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic005'>
<img src='images/illus277.jpg' alt='' class='ig005' />
<p>The sharp crack of the pistol was followed by another roar, more awful and awe-inspiring.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Without another word—without even notifying
them of his discovery,—Tom balanced the
revolver for an instant in his hand, and then
taking fair aim hesitated no longer, but pulled
the trigger.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hardly had his finger crooked before the
sharp crack of the pistol was followed by another
roar, infinitely more awful and awe-inspiring.
A blast of hot gas swept back in their
faces, and Tom felt himself being picked up
bodily by some mysterious force and dashed
against the rock. He realized no more. How
much later he recovered his senses he did not
know, but he opened his eyes to find daylight
streaming into the cave.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under the tremendously powerful forces of
Professor Dingle’s explosive the great rocking
stone had been, not blown to bits, but literally
melted away. But this they did not find out till
later. Tom’s first task was to arouse the others
who lay in a semi-stupor all about him. He got
the water canteen which had been brought with
them and dashed some of its contents in his companions’
faces. Presently they began to stir.
Except for a cut above the professor’s eye, where
a flying stone had struck him, they were uninjured.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the gases of the explosive had given them
all splitting headaches, and as soon as they had
recovered enough to be able to stand upright
they hastened toward the glorious daylight which
came pouring in—the daylight they thought
they had forever bidden farewell to.</p>

<p class='c006'>The storm had passed away, only distant grumblings
of thunder remaining to tell of it. The
sky was blue and clear once more. The lowness
of the sun showed that it must be late in
the afternoon. They must, therefore, have lain
unconscious for some time. The first thing to
be done was, of course, to make all haste away
from the spot. A glance about them showed that
by good fortune the ledge of rock remained intact.
But at its edge, and quite close to them,
lay a curious object which it was some time before
they made out to be a rifle.</p>

<p class='c006'>It must have been Simon Lake’s, and the
weapon had probably been torn from his pocket
by some freak of the same shaft of lightning
that sent him to his death in the depths below.
The electric fluid had actually melted the steel
and fused stock, lock and barrel into one mass of
molten metal. Tom shuddered as he thought
of the shock that must have passed through Lake
when the bolt struck.</p>

<p class='c006'>A feeling of gloom came over the party, for
base as Lake had been in life the manner of his
death was surely a terrible one. Perhaps it was
a retribution for his wild, lawless life. Tom at
least felt that perhaps this was so. One thing
was certain, the depths of the narrow rift would
prove his sepulchre, for to have recovered his
body from those profundities would have been
impossible.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Boss, me think me know um way to de cove
wot bad man tell about,” said Monday suddenly,
as they were discussing their next step.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do? Good boy!” cried Tom; “then lead
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, go in front,” said the professor, “but
first tell us how you come to know anything
about the path.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Long time ago, boss, as I tell you, me here
in whaler,” said Monday; “captain he bad man.
Beat me and Tuesday. Pretty soon we desert.
We come hide up in here. Find plenty paths
every place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Before many minutes they had climbed the
steep flight of natural steps leading to the cliff
summit, and stood there with a glorious panorama
at their feet. At least the beauty was there
to be enjoyed had they had the inclination or the
opportunity to gaze upon it.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the south lay the settlement. Its huts
looked like tiny toys from that height, and at
that distance. Between them and the settlement
the dark gorge stretched forbiddingly, and beyond
the gorge the eye rested on the endless
wastes of greenish-brown thicket. All about was
stretched the sea, and perhaps they did scan this
rather more closely than they had the rest of the
outlook. But if any of them had hoped to spy
a vessel—as men will hope for vain things—they
were disappointed. The vast stretches of
ocean about them were as empty of life as a
desert. Under the sun the waves glistened and
danced as if in mockery of their helplessness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what’s the course now?” inquired Mr.
Chillingworth presently, with an assumption of
cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We will head through the bush under Monday’s
guidance,” said the professor, “and find
the boat which Lake mentioned as being moored
in the cove. When we have found it we will row
as close to the settlement as we dare and try in
some way to secure food. But, of course, you
do not need to be told that my main object in
going there is to recover my boy. It was a
grievous oversight not to have brought him with
us; but it cannot be helped now. I think it only
fair to add that if any one is opposed to my program
that I will strike off alone when we
reach the coast and the rest of you can take the
boat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As if we would!” said Tom. “No, sir, we’ll
stand by you, and if we get recaptured trying
to get your boy, why, we won’t be any worse off
than we were before.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” agreed Mr. Chillingworth,
“we’ll stay with you till the finish, professor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As Monday and Tuesday had appeared to entertain
no doubts as to their place being at the
professor’s side, no more words were exchanged.
A start was at once made down the rough path
Monday declared would lead them in due course
to the cove where the boat, which Zeb Hunt and
Lake had used on their visits to the cave, was
moored. After some time spent in laboriously
traversing slippery rocks and pushing through
thorny scrub, they emerged at length on the
shores of a small cove.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom gave a shout as he discerned under some
overhanging bushes the outline of a small white
boat secured to the same clump which partially
concealed it from view.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The boat!” he cried. “So Lake did tell us the
truth, after all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Unfortunate fellow,” said the professor; “I
am glad that almost his last words to us were
not fabrications.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The little craft was soon cast loose, and with
the two pairs of oars found in her, the Kanakas
made her fairly skim over the water. Although
they were by no means out of their peril yet, and
were tired, hungry and thirsty, the adventurers
could not repress a low cheer as the boat forged
forward. At least they had a good boat under
them, and the ocean before them when once they
had secured the professor’s little boy and a store
of provisions.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sun’s disc was almost dipping below the
western rim of the sea as they emerged from
the cove, and the Kanakas, keeping cautiously
close to the shore, began to pull down the coast
toward the settlement. By the time they were
approaching a little wooded point jutting out
from the main part of the island it was almost
dark.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Beyond that point lies the settlement, according
to my calculations,” said Mr. Chillingworth.
“I think our best plan would be to run the boat
ashore at this side of the point and then clamber
over the little neck of land. In that way we can
see what is going on and how the land lies without
exposing our lives unnecessarily.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The others agreed with him that this would be
the best course to pursue, so drawing the boat
up on the beach, taking care that some trees
sheltered it from view, they set out to cross the
neck of land.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was almost as rough traveling as on the
trail, and in their exhausted condition it took
them longer than it ordinarily would to attain
the eminence. When they finally reached the
summit, however, and were able to see the other
side, they saw that Mr. Chillingworth’s guess had
been right. The settlement lay at their feet. In
the dim dusk the outlines of the big barnlike place
where the Chinese were housed, towered up starkly.
Out in the lagoon they could see the dark outlines
of the schooner as she swung at her anchorage.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as they gazed there came a startling
sound: the sharp report of a pistol, followed by
a regular fusillade of shots.</p>

<p class='c006'>The uproar seemed to come from the centre
of the collection of huts and shanties, and down
toward the beach. While they stood gazing,
dumb with astonishment at this new surprise, a
tongue of flame flickered upward from one of
the structures, and rapidly grew larger. The
conflagration momentarily roared higher, crimsoning
the sky and sea with a lurid glow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s the store!” cried Tom as he gazed at the
raging fire, “something terrible has happened.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mutiny and riot!” struck in Mr. Chillingworth,
as a wild noise of shouts and yells and
confused shooting was borne to their ears.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch23' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <br />HEMMED IN BY FLAMES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I guess that this is as far as it will be safe
to come.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was Mr. Chillingworth who spoke. The little
party had, by painfully creeping forward
down the side of the jutting headland, managed
to reach a position in the rear of the big shed
which housed the Chinese under ordinary conditions.
It now appeared, though, that it was
empty. Doubtless its occupants had either fled
in terror or had joined in the mad rioting.</p>

<p class='c006'>From their point of vantage they had a clear
view of all that was happening within the settlement
itself, lit up as the place was by the
glare-light.</p>

<p class='c006'>They could see men rushing about the streets,
if such the thoroughfares between the shanties
could be called. The red glow of the flames
shone on their faces, swollen and heated by the
fire and excitement, and perhaps by liquor, too.
For they could see where a group had gathered
about a big cask and was broaching it freely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good heavens,” exclaimed the rancher, “if
they have started drinking what will happen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The professor uttered a groan. Anxiety for
his boy was preying cruelly on him. He had all
he could do to keep himself from rushing out
from their hiding place and boldly demanding
the lad, be the consequences what they might.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hitherto, however, the counsel of the others
had prevented his taking such a mad step. In
the present mood of the men there was no telling
to what lengths their folly might lead them. All
felt that it would be dangerous to cross any of
them for the present at least.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly a louder shout than the frenzied
whoops and yells with which the mutineers had
been making the night hideous, rent the air. It
came from the neighborhood of the flames which
were now dying down. Evidently something was
taking place out of the ordinary.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They’re coming this way!” shouted the professor
presently; “what can have happened now!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Nearer and nearer grew the babel of shouts.
All at once, from around the corner of one of the
huts appeared the figure of a man. He was running.
Even at the distance at which they stood
they could catch his sharp, quick breaths. Whoever
the runner was he was almost spent. He
carried some object in his arms, too. It looked
like a sack of some sort.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hardly had the figure appeared before around
the corner in close pursuit of the runner there
flashed a dozen or more forms. They were
shouting wildly, and as they caught sight of their
quarry they set up a yell.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After him, boys!” came a shout from one of
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kill the dirty dog!” came another yell.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, he is the cause of all our troubles, the
beast!” screamed another voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good heavens, it’s Hunt!” cried Tom suddenly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And he has my boy in his arms!” shouted the
professor the next instant. Casting all prudence
aside, he dashed out of his hiding place toward
the almost spent runner. Hunt ran staggeringly,
reeling from side to side. He seemed to be
wounded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s all up now,” groaned Tom, as he saw the
lanky form of the scientist spring out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I don’t know that I blame him,” said
Chillingworth, “it’s his boy, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom nodded soberly, but made no verbal reply.
His wits were too hard at work trying to
devise something to do to get the professor out
of his predicament, for, as the scientist had
rushed up to Hunt and seized his boy from the
red-headed mate’s arms, the frenzied mutineers
had opened fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Follow me! Quick!” shouted Tom, as he perceived
the scientist’s danger. With the others
close at his heels he dashed out with a loud
“Whoop!”</p>

<p class='c006'>He calculated on the effect of his wild cry and
sudden appearance to check the onrush of the
mutineers. It worked as he had expected.
Stricken with astonishment they halted for an
instant. But that instant was enough.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here—get in here quick!” shouted Tom as he
grasped the professor and whirled him about.
The next moment the scientist had been propelled
by Tom’s strong young arms into the dark interior
of the deserted Chinese barracks. An instant
later his son followed him, and then came
Tom with the Kanakas and Mr. Chillingworth
who helped him in dragging Hunt’s limp form
for the mate had collapsed as the professor seized
the boy from his arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they all got safely inside Tom slammed the
big door to, securing it with a heavy bar which,
to his great delight, he had found on the inside.
This gave them breathing space and a chance
to lay Hunt, who seemed to be badly wounded,
on a pile of bedding in one corner of the place.
The man lay there panting for a few minutes,
and then opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What has happened?” he demanded, and then
he gasped out, “Oh, I know now. You caught
me and dragged me in here. It was pluckily
done of you, lad. But we are in a bad fix.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You think the mutineers will attack us,
then?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a doubt of it. I don’t know how you
come to be here, and there ain’t no time to ask
questions, but I’ll tell you what happened soon
after you left with Lake. A bunch of them fellers
came to ther store and said they had decided
that the time had come to make a general
distribution of all the grub and then set sail on
the schooner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, I told ’em to go about their business,
but they said that they was a committee,
and that if I didn’t let ’em ransack the provision
house there’d be trouble. It seems they thought
that Lake was lying to them about there being
little grub left, and that they had an idea there
was plenty. Well, to make a long story short,
when I refused to let ’em have the keys they
went away grumbling. Nothing happened till
sundown, when I shot down one chap I saw
sneaking up to the back door of the place.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That was the signal for the trouble that had
been smoldering. They charged down on the
place like a lot of angry wasps, and I grabbed
up the kid and ran. I saw it was no use to make
a fight. I hid in a disused hut till just now, when
they routed me out. Through a crack I watched
’em loot the storehouse. All the time they was
sayin’ what they’d do to me when they catched
me. Pretty soon they found kegs of rum in the
cellar, and then I knew it was about all over but
the shouting.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One feller suggests that they set the storehouse
on fire when they’d got everything out of
it, and presently I seen them touch a match to a
pile of tinder and start the blaze up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I watched for a while and then figgered that
if ever there was a chance of my escaping with
the kid it was right then. So I crept out of the
hut where I’d lain hidden. But as ill-luck would
have it, just at that instant a bunch of them ran
upon me. I started off in this direction, expecting
every minute to feel a bullet in my back. The
rest you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>All this time there had come no sign from the
mutineers. Outside things had, in fact, grown
quite quiet. Ominously so. It meant, according to
Tom’s way of thinking, that they were hatching
up some plan of attack on the big shed, and—not
one of its occupants had any more dangerous
weapon than a pocket knife.</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly a voice outside hailed them:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ahoy thar! in ther shed!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what is it?” shouted back Tom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Will you give us up Zeb Hunt?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do you want to do with him?” asked
Tom, while Hunt watched him with an agonized
look on his rough features.</p>

<p class='c006'>“String him up!” came the savage rejoinder.
“Send him out here and you shall all get off without
any bother frum us. But ef yer keep him
thar we’ll make you sorry fer it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You hear what he says,” said Tom, facing
round on the others, “what shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We would be a fine lot of cowards to give
this man up to them after he has saved my boy at
the risk of his life,” said the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s what I say,” chimed in Mr. Chillingworth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So do I,” agreed Tom, while Hunt sank back
with a breathed “God bless you!” It was the
most fervent wish that had ever left those lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wall, what be you a-goin’ ter do?” came the
voice. “The boys is gittin’ impatient.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can’t have Hunt!” hailed back Tom in
decisive tones.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What!” roared the fellow outside, “think of
what you’re a-doin’ of, youngster. It’s his life
or yours—now kin we hev him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not in the longest day you ever lived!”
shouted Tom, “now be off and do your worst.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No fear of that, younker,” the voice assured
him; “look out fer squalls!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If only we had some weapons,” exclaimed
Tom. He stepped over to Hunt, thinking that
perhaps the man had a pistol on him. But Hunt,
when addressed, did not answer, and Tom soon
made out that he had swooned again. Striking
a match Tom bent over him. The man’s shirt
was blood-stained, and he had, apparently, been
wounded in the shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s got grit, anyhow,” thought Tom. “He
never said a word about his wound.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom would have liked to doctor him there and
then, but that was out of the question. Before
the hastily struck match had died out there was
a wild yell from outside as the mutineers rushed
upon the place. But if they expected the stout
doors to yield they were mistaken. The portals
shook and swayed under the onslaught, but they
held firm.</p>

<p class='c006'>After battering furiously upon them with
blood-curdling threats as to what would happen
when they did get them open, the mutineers gave
over their fruitless task. Apparently they retired
to talk over some other plan of attack.</p>

<p class='c006'>This looked ominous. Enraged as they were
by their failure to carry the place at the first assault,
it was not likely they would risk a second
failure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope they don’t think of making a battering
ram,” thought Tom, “they’d have those doors
down in a jiffy if they did.”</p>

<p class='c006'>For some minutes thereafter they sat in silence,
listening intently for some sound which
might inform them of what the mutineers intended
to do next. In the meantime, the half-famished
refugees munched on some rice and
bread they had found spread out upon a rough
table just as the Chinamen had left it, apparently.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once Tom heard a queer sound—a sort
of scratching, scraping noise at one end of the
barn. It sounded as if something were being
piled against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>What could the mutineers be doing? Tom
racked his brain in vain for a solution of the
queer sounds for some minutes. Then he hit
upon an explanation. It was such a horrifying
one that every drop of blood seemed to leave his
heart at the bare idea.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was brush that was being piled against the
barn from the outside. Such a thing could have
only one meaning. The mutineers meant to set
the place on fire.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rapidly he communicated his fears to the others.
But before they had time to formulate any
way of facing this new peril there was the quick,
sharp scratch of a match outside.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the same instant a red glow shone through
the chinks of the boards. As the flames rose
higher, licking the sides of the barn, the mutineers
broke into brutal cries and taunts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You cowards!” shouted Tom desperately;
“do you mean to burn us alive?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes; you can all shrivel up like a bunch of
rats or else come out and be shot!”</p>

<p class='c006'>This utterance from one of the wretches outside
was greeted by a chorus of approving
shouts and yells. Tom turned despairingly to
the others. As he did so the barn began to fill
with smoke and hot sparks showered them. It
was evident that they must soon adopt one of the
alternatives hurled at them by the brutal mutineers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c007'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br />THE ROUND-UP.—CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As the hot breath of the flames grew more
ardent, Hunt began to stir uneasily upon his
couch. Suddenly the wounded man came out of
his swoon with a shout. He sat upright, staring
wildly about him, his blood-stained, wan
face illumined by the flames. But after his first
instant of confusion he perceived at once what
had happened.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The dogs!” he exclaimed, reeling to his feet,
“they’ve set the shed on fire. But we’ll outwit
them yet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom was at his side in an instant.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know a way by which we can get out
of here?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hunt nodded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s a good thing I come to when I did,” he
said, “or we all might have roasted in here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He shuffled rapidly to the other end of the
shed, and kneeling above a big, flat stone which
apparently served as a hearthstone for an open
grate, he pressed some sort of mechanism. Instantly,
before their astonished eyes, the stone
swung open, revealing a flight of steps.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A secret passage!” cried Tom, while the others
uttered exclamations of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right,” said Zeb, with a grin, “and the
best of it is that there are only two persons on
this island that knows of its existence. One’s
me, and tother’s Bully Banjo. We made it in
case a revenue should drop in here some day.
Then, d’ye see, all we would have had to do
would have been to herd the Chinks through it
and bring ’em out in the brush half a mile away.
But we never thought that we’d have to use it
to get away from our own men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By the way,” he said, gazing about stupidly
under the pain of his wound, “where is Sim
Lake?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll tell you about that later,” said Tom, “the
thing to do now is to get away. You go first,
you know the way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Led by the wounded man they plunged into
the dark abyss, the professor’s boy whining a
little at the idea of descending into the dark,
damp place. Tom came last, and he closed down
the big stone behind them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The passage was fairly commodious, and walking
single file and slightly stooped it was not
long before they reached the end of it and
emerged in a clearing in the brush.</p>

<p class='c006'>Looking around they could see behind them the
red glare of the fire and the figures of the mutineers
about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They little think what a march we’ve stolen
on them,” chuckled Tom as he gazed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose the cold-blooded rascals are waiting
for us to appear, or to see the shed cave in on
us,” added the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, they will be disappointed this trip,” said
Mr. Chillingworth, “but surely I am not mistaken.
By some strange chance that passage
has led us almost to the other side of the headland
where we left the boat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A few seconds of reconnoitering proved that
this was correct. They were, however, on the
hillside above the headland, so that they could
see down on the blazing building. It was not a
great way to the water, and they soon emerged
at the spot where they had left the boat. They
found everything as it had been when they came
away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Tom, “I guess we had better get
on board.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is your plan?” asked the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rather a desperate one,” rejoined Tom; “but
it is the only thing I can think of. We can’t
put to sea without provisions or water, that’s
certain. Now, on the schooner we can find both.
She is unguarded, and the only risk we run is
being seen from the shore.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“By Jove! that’s a great idea,” cried Mr.
Chillingworth. “As for being seen from land,
I don’t think there is any serious danger of that.
Those rascals are all too busy about their own
devices.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I agree with you,” said the professor. “It
might even be feasible to sail the schooner out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Tom shook his head at this daring suggestion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We don’t know the water hereabouts well
enough,” he said, “and might only pile her upon
shore. No; my idea was to stock up the boat
and then pull out to sea. We ought to be out of
sight of the island by daylight. Surely we can
either sight a steamer or the mainland by the
time our provisions get low.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With the Kanakas at the oars, and the
wounded man lying in the stern, the boat was
cautiously pulled toward the schooner. Tom’s
plans went through without a hitch. The men
filled six water kegs and selected all the biscuit
and provisions they wished, Zeb Hunt helping
them with suggestions as to the best stores to
take. During this time Tom found a chance to
tell him of the fate of Simon Lake. Hunt sank
down on a coil of rope, his head in his hands, as
he heard. He was genuinely affected, for he had
been fond of his leader in his rough way.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor Bully Banjo,” he said at length, rising
to his feet. “It’s the way he’d have wished to
die. But it’s sickened me of this business. If
ever I get clear of here I’m goin’ ter live honest
and clean. I’ve tried the other way, and it don’t
pay. For every bad deed a man does he has to
pay in just so many days of unhappiness—that’s
been my experience.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I believe you are right,” said Tom, “badness
never pays. It’s only men and boys who live
right who are happy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently a soft hail from the professor apprised
them that the boat was ready.</p>

<p class='c006'>One by one they slipped down the Jacob’s ladder,
which was always hanging from the schooner’s
side when she was at anchor. Before many
minutes had passed the boat, with her anxious
passengers, had cleared the point and was being
headed around the further point of the island toward
the east. They knew that by keeping on in
that direction long enough they would strike
land. As they had provisions and water enough
for several days on board they felt no anxiety
on that score, and their hearts were light as they
rowed through the darkness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before long the professor and Mr. Chillingworth
dropped off to sleep. Tom and Zeb Hunt
sat alone in the stern talking in low voices, while
the two Kanakas rowed steadily as automatons.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once Tom gave a shout.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look! Look! A steamer’s lights!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whereaway, boy?” came Zeb Hunt’s fog-horn
voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Off to the south—look, she’s coming toward
us!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re right, boy,” growled Hunt. If it
had been light Tom would have seen that a curiously
anxious look crept over his companion’s
face. The coming of a steamer meant to Zeb
Hunt that he would be placed in irons and taken
back to the United States to work out the penalty
for his crimes. But he said nothing, and presently
the entire boatload was watching the oncoming
steamer.</p>

<p class='c006'>As she drew closer Tom made out that she
was a small white vessel like a yacht. Her lights
glowed brightly, both from her portholes and on
deck. Evidently her company was up and about.
Perhaps they had sighted the fire on the island,
which was casting a blood-red glare on sea and
sky.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ship ahoy!” hailed Tom suddenly as the vessel
drew closer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ahoy yourself!” came an amazed voice from
the foredeck of the vessel, “who the dickens are
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A crew of castaways!” rejoined Tom.
“Throw us a line, will you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>But now another voice struck in from the
strange vessel’s deck:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tom! Oh, Tom!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jack!” cried the amazed lad, recognizing his
brother’s voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hooray, we’ve found them!” came another
voice, that of Sam Hartley. “Hooray, my lads!
Three cheers!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They were given with a will while the small
boat was rowed alongside the larger vessel. A
gangway was lowered and a perfect bombardment
of questions began to rain down. It was
impossible to answer them all, but in the babel
the rancher recognized the voice of his wife.</p>

<p class='c006'>Well, there is no use trying to give the details
of the scene that ensued when the castaways were
all safely on the deck of the big steam yacht—for
such she was—and the small boat was towing
astern.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the first place everybody talked at once, and
Mrs. Chillingworth laughed and then cried, and
then cried and laughed again. It was the most
joyous reunion the high seas had ever witnessed.
And through it all only one figure stood apart—that
of Zeb Hunt. Presently he slipped away
and made his way to the stern, where the boat
with her provisions and water on board was towing
along.</p>

<p class='c006'>Taking a swift glance around Zeb, despite his
wound, hoisted himself over the stern rail, and
with the agility of a sailor, dropped into the small
craft. Then he drew his knife and slashed the
rope. Free of the yacht the boat dropped rapidly
astern in the darkness. As the large vessel’s
lights grew dimmer and died out, Hunt took up
the oars.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It ain’t so very far frum here to the Canady
shore,” he muttered; “and once there I’ll be safe
frum the law.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He gave a shudder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I guess what that kid said was right,” he
muttered, “it don’t pay ter be bad, an’ frum now
on Zeb Hunt’s goin’ ter turn over a new leaf.”</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c006'>In the meantime, in the lighted saloon of the
yacht, the castaways had told their story, and
then Mr. Dacre and Sam Hartley started in on
theirs, part of which we know. On a lounge
sat Jack and Tom, their arms entwined round
each other’s necks, while Mr. Chillingworth and
his wife sat happily side by side listening to the
excited hum of talk. At some distance from the
rest sat the bottle-nosed man; still he was a
sharer in the general jubilation, too, for it was
he who had piloted the yacht to the island.</p>

<p class='c006'>But we are running ahead of Sam Hartley’s
narrative a little. Our readers will recall what
Mr. Chillingworth and Tom did not, of course,
know, namely, the Secret Service man’s visit to
the captain of the “Islander.” From the description
of the schooner the bottle-nosed man recognized
Bully Banjo’s craft, while Sam Hartley
easily identified Tom from the description the
captain was able to give of the boy who had
sprung into the shrouds and hailed them.</p>

<p class='c006'>This done, the next thing to do was to get hold
of Mr. Dacre and telegraph to Washington about
the results that had been attained. A dozen assistants
had been rushed to Sam at once, and a
week later the trim yacht “Idle Hour,” under
the flag of the U. S. Treasury Department, had
set sail from Puget Sound for a mysterious destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had sighted the fire a few hours before
they picked up the boat and it had caused them
a lot of apprehension. It looked as if things had
come to a crisis too soon. But as it happened,
things could not have fallen out better for Sam
Hartley’s purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>They anchored that night off the island, while
all hands took a much-needed rest, and in the
morning they landed. The followers of Bully
Banjo, stupefied by drink and reckless rioting,
were an easy prey for the Secret Service men,
who soon had them transferred to the schooner.
It had been decided to tow the vessel into the
nearest port, using her as a prison ship in the
meantime.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chinamen who had fled in terror to the
brush when the rioting broke out, drifted back
one by one. They were rounded up and the situation
explained to them. As it was impossible to
take them on the schooner they were left on the
island with plenty of provisions from the yacht
till a Canadian government schooner could call
for them and deport them to China.</p>

<p class='c006'>A few days after these arrangements had
been completed, the “Idle Hour” sailed for Seattle
with the schooner in tow. In the meantime,
the mine had been visited once more—by way
of the cove—and several samples of ore taken
from it, which the professor decided to assay
when they reached port. He thinks, however,
that they will prove to be very rich, and already
negotiations are under way to acquire the mine.
When the Bungalow Boys and Professor Dingle
do secure a right to work it the Kanakas will
have a goodly share of the proceeds, and Mr.
Chillingworth will not be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c006'>Once more in Seattle Mr. Chillingworth was
anxious for the party to return to his ranch, but
the boys and Mr. Dacre both felt that they had
seen about all they wanted of that part of the
country. They therefore accepted the professor’s
invitation to visit him later at his home on
the Great Lakes. First, however, they gave their
evidence against the captured mutineers, all of
whom were given sentences of more or less severity,
including the treacherous Fu.</p>

<p class='c006'>We could tell many things about the pleasant
times the boys spent in the great metropolis of
the northwest, and of some of the wonders they
saw in that part of the wonderful Pacific Slope.
But it is now time to leave them for a brief space.</p>

<p class='c006'>We shall meet them again in a new tale of their
adventures, even more exciting and thrilling than
its forerunners. This volume will be called “The
Bungalow Boys on the Great Lakes.”</p>

<p class='c012'><b>BEN STONE AT OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Under peculiarly trying circumstances
Ben Stone wins his way at
Oakdale Academy, and at the
same time enlists our sympathy,
interest and respect. Through the
enmity of Bern Hayden, the loyalty
of Roger Eliot and the clever work
of the “Sleuth,” Ben is falsely accused,
championed and vindicated.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>BOYS OF OAKDALE ACADEMY.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>“One thing I will claim, and that
is that all Grants fight open and
square and there never was a sneak among them.” It was
Rodney Grant, of Texas, who made the claim to his friend,
Ben Stone, and this story shows how he proved the truth
of this statement in the face of apparent evidence to the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>RIVAL PITCHERS OF OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Baseball is the main theme of this interesting narrative,
and that means not only clear and clever descriptions of
thrilling games, but an intimate acquaintance with the
members of the teams who played them. The Oakdale
Boys were ambitious and loyal, and some were even disgruntled
and jealous, but earnest, persistent work won out.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>OAKDALE BOYS IN CAMP.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>The typical vacation is the one that means much freedom,
little restriction, and immediate contact with “all out-doors.”
These conditions prevailed in the summer camp of
the Oakdale Boys and made it a scene of lively interest.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE GREAT OAKDALE MYSTERY.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>The “Sleuth” scents a mystery! He “follows his nose.”
The plot thickens! He makes deductions. There are
surprises for the reader—and for the “Sleuth,” as well.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>NEW BOYS AT OAKDALE.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>A new element creeps into Oakdale with another year’s
registration of students. The old and the new standards

<p class='c012'><b>FRANK ARMSTRONG’S VACATION.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>How Frank’s summer experience
with his boy friends make
him into a sturdy young athlete
through swimming, boating, and
baseball contests, and a tramp
through the Everglades, is the
subject of this splendid story.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>FRANK ARMSTRONG AT QUEENS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>We find among the jolly boys
at Queen’s School, Frank, the student-athlete, Jimmy, the
baseball enthusiast, and Lewis, the unconsciously-funny
youth who furnishes comedy for every page that bears
his name. Fall and winter sports between intensely rival
school teams are expertly described.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>FRANK ARMSTRONG’S SECOND TERM.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>The gymnasium, the track and the field make the background
for the stirring events of this volume, in which
David, Jimmy, Lewis, the “Wee One” and the “Codfish”
figure, while Frank “saves the day.”</p>

<p class='c012'><b>FRANK ARMSTRONG, DROP KICKER.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>With the same persistent determination that won him
success in swimming, running and baseball playing, Frank
Armstrong acquired the art of “drop kicking,” and the
Queen’s football team profits thereby.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>How the Bungalow Boys received
their title and how they retained the
right to it in spite of much opposition
makes a lively narrative for lively boys.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS MAROONED IN THE TROPICS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>A real treasure hunt of the most
thrilling kind, with a sunken Spanish
galleon as its object, makes a
subject of intense interest at any
time, but add to that a band of desperate men, a dark plot
and a devil fish, and you have the combination that brings
strange adventures into the lives of the Bungalow Boys.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS IN THE GREAT NORTHWEST.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>The clever assistance of a young detective saves the boys
from the clutches of Chinese smugglers, of whose nefarious
trade they know too much. How the Professor’s invention relieves
a critical situation is also an exciting incident of this book.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE BUNGALOW BOYS ON THE GREAT LAKES.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>The Bungalow Boys start out for a quiet cruise on the
Great Lakes and a visit to an island. A storm and a band
of wreckers interfere with the serenity of their trip, and a
submarine adds zest and adventure to it.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS’ LOST MINE.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>This is an absorbing story of the
continuous adventures of a motor
car in the hands of Nat Trevor and
his friends. It does seemingly impossible
“stunts,” and yet everything
happens “in the nick of time.”</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS THROUGH THE SIERRAS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Enemies in ambush, the peril of
fire, and the guarding of treasure
make exciting times for the Motor
Rangers—yet there is a strong flavor of fun and freedom,
with a typical Western mountaineer for spice.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS ON BLUE WATER;</b> or, The Secret of the Derelict.</p>

<p class='c012'>The strange adventures of the sturdy craft “Nomad” and
the stranger experiences of the Rangers themselves with

of this well-spun yarn of the sea.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR RANGERS’ CLOUD CRUISER.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>From the “Nomad” to the “Discoverer,” from the sea to
the sky, the scene changes in which the Motor Rangers figure.
They have experiences “that never were on land or sea,”
in heat and cold and storm, over mountain peak and lost
city, with savages and reptiles; their ship of the air is attacked
by huge birds of the air; they survive explosion and
earthquake; they even live to tell the tale!</p>

<p class='c012'>Especially interesting and timely
is this book which introduces the
reader with its heroes, Ned and Herc,
to the great ships of modern warfare
and to the intimate life and surprising
adventures of Uncle Sam’s sailors.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ABOARD A DESTROYER.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>In this story real dangers threaten
and the boys’ patriotism is tested in
a peculiar international tangle. The scene is laid on the
South American coast.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON A SUBMARINE.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>To the inventive genius—trade-school boy or mechanic—this
story has special charm, perhaps, but to every reader its
mystery and clever action are fascinating.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ON AERO SERVICE.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Among the volunteers accepted for Aero Service are Ned
and Herc. Their perilous adventures are not confined to the
air, however, although they make daring and notable flights
in the name of the Government; nor are they always able
to fly beyond the reach of their old “enemies,” who are also
airmen.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE BOY INVENTORS’ WIRELESS TELEGRAPH.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Blest with natural curiosity,—sometimes
called the instinct of investigation,—favored
with golden
opportunity, and gifted with creative
ability, the Boy Inventors
meet emergencies and contrive
mechanical wonders that interest
and convince the reader because
they always “work” when put to
the test.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE BOY INVENTORS’ VANISHING GUN.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>A thought, a belief, an experiment; discouragement,
hope, effort and final success—this is the history of many
an invention; a history in which excitement, competition,
danger, despair and persistence figure. This merely suggests
the circumstances which draw the daring Boy Inventors
into strange experiences and startling adventures,
and which demonstrate the practical use of their vanishing
gun.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE BOY INVENTORS’ DIVING TORPEDO BOAT.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>As in the previous stories of the Boy Inventors, new
and interesting triumphs of mechanism are produced
which become immediately valuable, and the stage for
their proving and testing is again the water. On the
surface and below it, the boys have jolly, contagious fun,
and the story of their serious, purposeful inventions
challenge the reader’s deepest attention.</p>

face in this exciting tale.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE BORDER BOYS ACROSS THE FRONTIER.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Read of the Haunted Mesa and its
mysteries, of the Subterranean River
and its strange uses, of the value of
gasolene and steam “in running the gauntlet,” and you will
feel that not even the ancient splendors of the Old World
can furnish a better setting for romantic action than the
Border of the New.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE BORDER BOYS WITH THE MEXICAN RANGERS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>As every day is making history—faster, it is said, than

They are stronger, braver and more resourceful than ever,
and the exigencies of their life in connection with the
Texas Rangers demand all their trained ability.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>MOLLY BROWN’S FRESHMAN DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Would you like to admit to your
circle of friends the most charming
of college girls—the typical college
girl for whom we are always looking
but not always finding; the type
that contains so many delightful
characteristics, yet without unpleasant
perfection in any; the
natural, unaffected, sweet-tempered
girl, loved because she is lovable?
Then seek an introduction to Molly
Brown. You will find the baggage-master, the cook, the
Professor of English Literature, and the College President
in the same company.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>MOLLY BROWN’S SOPHOMORE DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>What is more delightful than a re-union of college girls
after the summer vacation? Certainly nothing that precedes
it in their experience—at least, if all class-mates
are as happy together as the Wellington girls of this
story. Among Molly’s interesting friends of the second
year is a young Japanese girl, who ingratiates her “humbly”
self into everybody’s affections speedily and permanently.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>MOLLY BROWN’S JUNIOR DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Financial stumbling blocks are not the only things that
hinder the ease and increase the strength of college girls.
Their troubles and their triumphs are their own, often
peculiar to their environment. How Wellington students
meet the experiences outside the class-rooms is worth the
doing, the telling and the reading.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS AROUND THE WORLD.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Could Jules Verne have dreamed
of encircling the globe with a motor
cycle for emergencies he would have
deemed it an achievement greater
than any he describes in his account
of the amusing travels of Phileas
Fogg. This, however, is the purpose
successfully carried out by the Motor
Cycle Chums, and the tale of their
mishaps, hindrances and delays is
one of intense interest, secret amusement,
and incidental information to
the reader.</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS OF THE NORTHWEST PATROL.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>The Great Northwest is a section of vast possibilities
and in it the Motor Cycle Chums meet adventures even
more unusual and exciting than many of their experiences
on their tour around the world. There is not a dull page
in this lively narrative of clever boys and their attendant
“Chinee.”</p>

<p class='c013'><b>THE MOTOR CYCLE CHUMS IN THE GOLD FIELDS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>The gold fever which ran its rapid course through the
veins of the historic “forty-niners” recurs at certain intervals,
and seizes its victims with almost irresistible
power. The search for gold is so fascinating to the
seekers that hardship, danger and failure are obstacles
that scarcely dampen their ardour. How the Motor Cycle
Chums were caught by the lure of the gold and into what
difficulties and novel experiences they were led, makes a
tale of thrilling interest.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS’ SCHOOL DAYS.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Billie Campbell was just the type
of a straightforward, athletic girl
to be successful as a practical
Motor Maid. She took her car, as
she did her class-mates, to her
heart, and many a grand good time
did they have all together. The
road over which she ran her
red machine had many an unexpected
turning,—now it led her
into peculiar danger; now into contact
with strange travelers; and again into experiences
by fire and water. But, best of all, “The Comet” never
failed its brave girl owner.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY PALM AND PINE.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>Wherever the Motor Maids went there were lively times,
for these were companionable girls who looked upon the
world as a vastly interesting place full of unique adventures—and
so, of course, they found them.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS ACROSS THE CONTINENT.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>It is always interesting to travel, and it is wonderfully
entertaining to see old scenes through fresh eyes. It is
that privilege, therefore, that makes it worth while to join
the Motor Maids in their first ’cross-country run.</p>

<p class='c012'><b>THE MOTOR MAIDS BY ROSE, SHAMROCK AND HEATHER.</b></p>

<p class='c012'>South and West had the Motor Maids motored, nor
could their education by travel have been more wisely
begun. But now a speaking acquaintance with their own
country enriched their anticipation of an introduction to
the British Isles. How they made their polite American
bow and how they were received on the other side is a
tale of interest and inspiration.</p>
